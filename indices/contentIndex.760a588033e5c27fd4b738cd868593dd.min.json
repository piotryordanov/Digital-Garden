And it draws heavily on a multitude of techniques from different buddhist traditions without championing one idea over another in particular.\n\nI originally started reading the book in 2017 when I wanted to acquire more focus and concentration at work.\nTo this day, i keep on revising the book because as my meditation practice matures, some elements become more obvious today.\n\n## The 10 stages\nThe stages can be simplified in the following:\n1. Establish the practice\n2. 'Aha' moments when attention recognizes it lost focus on the breath\n3. Less forgetting, mind wandering and sleepiness\n4. Purifications and overcoming gross distractions\n5. Sustain or even increase the power of mindfulness\n6. [Metacognitive Introspective Awareness](ysfdwtmo)\n7. Jhanas and [Insight (VipassanƒÅ)](tpi5wwns)\n8. Pacification of sense, and rise of meditative joy\n9. Tranquitlity and [Equanimity](2ou0gfth) replacing joy\n10. Effortless stable attention, mindfulness, joy, tranquility, and equanimity persist away from the cushion\n\n\nThe stages are not sequential, and thus it is possible for anyone to have an experience of an advances stage.\nHowever, that experience might not be sustainable due to the lack of experience.\n\nInstead, it's best for us meditators to recognize in which stage we most likely are, in order to recognize the challenges we are most likely to face, and best practice to deal with them.\nFor example, I remember when I went over stage 4, I experienced random moments of joy and sadness during the way, without any underlying explanation.\nTurned out, this is called purification. It is the result of the [Mindfulness](fzngle24) muscle working on its own outside of the meditation practice. Thus, on an unconscious level, memories are being processed.\nIn this case, it is best to do less [mindfulness](fzngle24) meditation, and instead explore [analytical meditation](g2lj5miv).\nThis is a style of meditation where we ask a question and wait and see what answers rises and manifests in consciousness.\nThe goal is to help the unconscious put into words that experience it is having.\n\nWith practice, I discovered that either putting the right word to describe the experience, or finding the exact spot in the body where the experience is expressing itself, provides a great feeling of relief in the face of disturbing emotions.\n\n## The theory\nThe book covert a great deal of buddhist philosophy. While there might be a tendency to read it in one go, it often proved useful to me to take the time to explore what each idea means.\nFor example, the concept of pacification of the mind, or the doctrine of [Impermanence](bwrx09ol), in particular the impermanence of the self. All of these are often relatively short to explain, and yet, experiencing them - in particular the impermanence of the self - can be nerve wrecking experiences.","lastmodified":"2022-04-17T16:25:33.214077325Z","tags":null},"/tmic0p2e":{"title":"Arch linux","content":"Arch Linux.

Lack of body flexibility is the problem.\nSo, I tried doing exercises to reinforce that, but it led to physical pain, leaving me in panic that I might no longer be able to sit in meditation if I were to suffer an injury.\nHowever, this fear calmed down in an instant after a video call with my mother, who showed me which exercise caused my actual pain.\nShe also guided me to do the exercises that would benefit my end goal of cultivating stretching, flexibility, and thus sitting in full lotus during meditation.\n\n### Divergence with Sanghas\n\nAs for the sangha, I have come to be disillusioned by their 'importance', in particular the plum village one.\nThis was obvious this week.\nI went from wanting to be heavily invested in organizing events within the Sangha, into being almost mute during the 8-people gathering on Tuesday that was meant to organize the group!\nThe reason is quite deep, and it comes from a divergence in my reading of what the Sangha is.\nTo make it short, people in both Sanghas I meditate with, do not know of any other Sanghas, and are a bit too fixated on their own practice.\nThere is in each one, a big element of veneration to either the teacher, or the teachings of that particular sangha. (ex. In zen, it is the posture. At plum, it is the 5 mindfulness trading)\nHowever, I find there is a contraction between this, and the 4 noble truth, in particular the second one that stipulated that suffering comes from our *attachment* to **impermanent** things.\n\nYes, I have found refuge in the plum retreat of NYE, because I found like-minded people.\nBut, I also heavily resisted the ceremonial aspect of their practice -- too much herd mentality needed.\nLast week I finally came to understand [The 8-fold path](kxqaql4m) , and with it came an appreciation of [The 3 jewels](82wh78at): The Buddha, the dharma, and finally, the sangha.\n\nHowever, I had an itch annoying me.\nIf the 3 jewels included the sangha, did that mean that the physical presence in a sangha was imperative? If yes, then which? And why this one, not the other? Why this teacher, not another one?\nAnd how does that align with the Zen teaching of \"there is nothing to do?\".\n\nIs it also possible that there be a conflict of interest here?\nMaybe a Sangha considers a Sangha to be a Jewel, in order to find a reason to keep a Sangha alive. After all, the Buddha nature is not bounded by a single person or place. Is it like the force, ever present to the Jedi willing and able to tap into it.\n\nThis internal conflict resulted in me feeling as if I was losing that connection to a meditation community that has been flourishing for the past 2 months.\nBut now, I understand that instead, I didn't lose anything, because there was nothing to lose in the first place!\nFrom the very first day, I got there knowing I did not want to 'belong' anywhere. I went to Zazen for my 'Jedi training', not to do Zazen, for ex.\n\nBut as time passed, it is but normal that the community members would interact with me differently, and I would find value in them. This value creates the fear of loss at the sign of divergence.\nBut, losing what?\nAll I want, and need, is a place to sit and practice meditation as it speaks to *me*, not as it speaks to other.\nThe reality is that no one will ever really know how much progress I am making in my practice. We never actually sit and talk about our own practices and progress in these practices, do we now! (It happened punctually at plum retreat with some bright minds)\n\n### The 3 Jewels\nThe piece of information that I was missing in my understanding of the 3 Jewels, is that both the Buddha and the Sangha do **not** to be physical entities.\nThe Buddha can be a reference to the Buddha nature, such as the force.\nThis nature is manifested when an action is taken that is aligned with the 8-fold path.\nThat's all there is.\n\nAs for the Sangha, let's go back to the definition. It is supposed to be the spiritual community that provides us support on our path to enlightenment.\nGreat, but then does that Sangha need to be a physical one of Buddhist practitioners?\nThis begs two critical questions:\n1. What would a Sangha for lay people who do not want to engage in monastic life? Competitive people, entrepreneurs, and builders who want to go out there in the world and make things?\n2. Which Sangha should one be part of? And as such, what to do if the 'spiritual Sangha' where I live, does not provide deeper support on the path to enlightenment?\n\nI used the second question as a base to reverse engineer the problem: A Sangha can be, but is not necessarily, a community of actual people you meet and spend time with.\nAwakening does not only happen in a Buddhist temple surrounded by Buddhist monks.\nIt is a manifestation of living life in an awakened way, by being close to the 8-fold path.\nRight?\nSo, maybe... a Sangha can be literally any person we are going to interact with.\nThis is the exact same thing as when we do not communicate what is happening during silent meditations.\nIf I am at Carrefour buying grocery, the cashier is offering me the opportunity to smile, be gentle, and respond skillfully and mindfully to potential issues.\nDoing so *is* a sign of enlightenment!","lastmodified":"2022-04-17T16:25:33.214077325Z","tags":null},"/xikhdqga":{"title":"Meditation is not about becoming a monk","content":"---\n\nI consider [meditation](30m0jqb0) to be the art of systematically training the mind üß†.\nThe goal is to make it effortless for me to react to events in life.\n\n# üß† Training\nThe mental image I have of myself meditating is less that of a monk, and more that of a Jedi, or a Samurai.\n\n## The Jedi\nJedis practice meditation in order to reinforce, among other things, their affinity to the force.\nThe force exists in the universe, and the jedi has to figure out how to communicate with it.\nIt is fundamentally outside of his control, and it requires a great deal of giving in, and trust, in order to tap into it.\n\nThe Sith, are the Jedis that allowed fear, anger, and greed to take over.\n\nHowever, I do not like the Jedi as portrayed in movies, because it is too pure and thus unrealistic.\nThey insist too much on the need to resist darkness.\nOn the contrary, there is great deal of learning that can come from sitting with the darkness, and studying it.\n\nI like most the Gray Jedis. My favorite is the last sentence in the Gray jedi code:\n\u003e In life, there is freedom\n\u003e\n\u003e In death, there is purpose\n\nThe part on death is critical to understand, as the cycle of death and rebirth is core to buddhism.\nBecause everything is impermanent, it thus follows that everything dies.\nAs such, the limited resources and time at hand, invite the Jedi to find a meaningful purpose that would drive their actions.\n\nIn life, there are the possibilities seem limitless. Thereby lies the freedom of choice.\nBut, the fact that everything dies, means that the meditator needs to be careful and deliberate about time.\n\n\n## The Samurai and the study of patience\n\nWhat fascinates me in the Samurai is not the martial art, but the discipline and patience.\nDiscipline is obvious. Without it, no warrior can put in the hours to train and become fearless on the battlefield.\n\nHowever patience is less understood, and tends to be neglected.\nI invite you to reflect on this famous quote by Ieyasu Tokugawa:\n\n\u003e There are 7 emotions: Joy, anger, anxiety, adoration, grief, fear, and hate\n\u003e\n\u003e If a man does not give way to these, he can be called patient\n\nThe key is that patience is not in the face of time, but rather emotions.\nThat is true for both happy as well as sad emotions.\n\nThe Samurai is thus invited to study patience.\nTo examine how these emotions rise and fall. To the experienced eye, they are clearly in charge of their life.\n\nThis is exactly what happens during mindfulness meditation where both good and bad emotions challenge the focus on the breath.","lastmodified":"2022-04-17T16:25:33.214077325Z","tags":null},"/ysfdwtmo":{"title":"Metacognitive Introspective Awareness","content":"Metacognitive introspective awareness is essentially the cognition of being aware of your own cognition.\n\nTo break the 3 words down:\n1.
