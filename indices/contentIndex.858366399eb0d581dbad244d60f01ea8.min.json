This is the typical understanding of happiness (Happiness of slavery). In the Dhamma sense, however, happiness is when there is no hunger or want at all, when we're completely free of all hunger, desire, and want. (Happiness of Freedom)\n  \nOur sense of happiness is so brittle, it can be destroyed simply by asking whether or not it exists.\n\n# Happiness\n\n## The 2 happiness\n\nImagine, if you can, that you are the sole owner of the world, of the universe, of the entire cosmos. Now that you're the owner of everything, does hunger stop? Can it stop? Would you please examine this carefully with and in your own mind. If you were to get everything that you could possibly desire, to the point that you owned the whole world, would your hunger cease? Or would you hunger for a second universe? Would you want a third?\n\nConsider the fact that hunger never ends by our attempts to satisfy it. In spite of this, the world today continues to develop the kind of education and evolution that seek merely to produce things which are more lovely and satisfying. Modern technology and science are slaves of hunger. Our world is falling into this deep hole of endlessly producing increasingly seductive things to try to satisfy hunger. But where are you going to find happiness in such a world?\n\n**Example:**\n\n    The new-born infant is happy when it is cuddled in its mother's arms and sucks milk from her breast. This satisfies the infant until it grows a little older, a little bigger. Then the mother's arms and breast aren‚Äôt enough. It learns about other foods and delights. Now its happiness depends on ice cream, candy, and junk food, on playing little games and running around the house. Then it grows older and those games don't satisfy the child any more. It wants to play football or play with dolls. These two are outgrown eventually and the teenager's interests and happiness revolve around sex. The previous kinds of satisfaction are of no more interest. When they become young men and women, don't expect them to be satisfied with the old types of happiness. Now, all they think about is sex and dates. Finally, the human being marries, becomes a wife or husband, and has hopes and wishes tied up in a house, money, and possessions. There's no way they can be satisfied with childish happiness (unless they haven't really grown up) The human being changes from stage to stage, and happiness also changes from stage to stage. It is continuous and endless. Hunger develops from stage to stage until death. After that, many believe, there is rebirth as a deva (celestial being, like angels): and still there's hunger, heavenly hunger for the happiness of devas. It never stops. Even in heaven with the gods or in the kingdom of God, should such things exist, hunger doesn't stop. In Buddhism these all are considered to be examples of worldly happiness that only deceives and confuses.    \n\n## When does hunger stop?\n\nWe must take this other path where there is no hunger. The essence of this path is the absence of the feeling of self, of \"I\" and \"mine\". \n\nIt is necessary to realize this connection between the end of hunger and the cessation of the self illusion. \n\nHunger persists as this self seeks to acquire things for itself without ever truly succeeding. \n\nWe desire one kind of 'the best', but as soon as we get it our hunger reaches after a better 'the best'. This has no end as long as there's self that wants 'the best‚Äô. Through our grasping at \"the best\" we're burdened also with \"the worst\". \n\nTo be free of all *dukkha*, the mind must be beyond good and evil, above best and worst-that is , it must dwell in voidness.  In voidness hunger stops and there is true happiness.\n\n## The Tree of Knowledge\n\nThose of you who are Christians or who have read the Bible will be familiar with the story of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that appears at the beginning of Genesis. It tells how God forbade Adam and Eve to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. He warned them that they would die if they did not obey. If you understand the meaning of this passage, you will understand the core of Buddhism. When there is no knowledge of good and evil, we can't attach to them, we're void and free of dukkha. Once we know about good and evil, we attach to them and must suffer dukkha. The fruit of that tree is this attachment to good and evil. This causes dukkha and dukkha is death, spiritual death.\n\nWe identify things as good and attach to them. We identify things as bad and detach from them. We are trapped in worldly conditions by our dualistic obsession with good and bad. This is the death of which God warned. Will you heed his warning?\n\nThe Buddhist solution is to be above good and evil to be void.\n\nDon't attach to good and evil because they are impermanent (anicca), unsatisfactory (dukkha), and not-self (anatta). Good and evil are anicca, dukkha, anatta. \n\nIf we grasp and cling to \"good\", we are hungry for good. If we have what is the best, we hunger for the best. No matter how \"best\" something is, it still causes hunger. \n\n## Natural vs Unnecessary Hunger\n\nThe body instinctually feels hunger regarding its natural needs: clothing, food, shelter, medicine, exercise. This kind of hunger is no problem. It doesn't cause dukkha and can be satisfied without causing dukkha.\n\nThen, there is the second kind of hunger, which is mental, that we call \"*spiritual hunger*\". This is the hunger of thinking born out of attachment. Spiritual hunger, being tied up with ignorance (avijja) and attachment (upadana), destroys the coolness and calm of the mind, which is true happiness and peace, thus bringing dukkha.\n\n\u003e Through attachment the human mind knows spiritual hunger.\n\nThe body has a nervous system. When it lacks something that it needs there arises a certain activity which we call \"hunger\". That's all there is to it -- tathata. Don't let it cook up into spiritual hunger by attaching to it as \"my hunger\" or the \"I who hunger\".\n\nWhen the body is hungry, eat mindfully and wisely. Then physical hunger won't disturb the mind.\n\n# Emptiness\n\nWe cannot get rid of suffering by saying, \"I will not suffer.\" We cannot eliminate attachment by saying, \"I will not be attached to anything,\" nor eliminate aggression by saying, \"I will never become angry.\" Yet, we do want to get rid of suffering and the disturbing emotions that are the immediate cause of suffering. \nThe Buddha taught that to eliminate these states, which are really the results of the primary confusion of our belief in a personal self, we must get rid of the fundamental cause. \nBut we cannot simply say, \"I will not believe in the personal self.\" The only way to eliminate suffering is to actually recognize the experience of a self as a misconception, which we do by proving directly to ourselves that there is no such personal self. We must actually realise this. Once we do, then automatically the misconception of a self and our fixation on that \"self\" will disappear. \nOnly by directly experiencing selflessness can we end the process of confused projection. This is why the Buddha emphasized meditation on selflessness or egolessness (emptiness). \nHowever, to meditate on egolessness, we must undertake a process that begins with a conceptual understanding of egolessness; then, based on that understanding, there can be meditation, and finally realization.\n\nInstead of focusing on differences and individuality, the realisation of emptiness is about realising that nothing exists by itself alone, but depends on other things. Just as all living beings rely on other living beings - at least their ancestors, so do even inanimate objects depend on other objects, conditions, parts and processes to arise and disappear.\n  \nTo put it simple, our perception of the world is only possible because of interaction, interrelation, dependence and exchange of information.\n  \n## Perception\n\nWhen we perceive an object, we automatically tend to label it (like nice, bad, wet, dry, light, dark, etc.). As soon as our mind puts a label  on an object, the label takes the place of the actual object in our mental processes. As our mental image or label can never represent all the different qualities and characteristics of any object, it is always just a simplified, usually exaggerated, subjective snap shot. However, our mind reacts on the basis of our own mental label of an object. No wonder we tend to react simplistic, exaggerated and subjective in many situations. All perceived objects are conditioned by our senses and our own mind. \nThis leads to the dramatic conclusion that we are not and by definition can never be objective!\n\n- - - -\n\nStop insisting on one-sided positions\n\nThe world nowadays is so overwhelmed by the power of advertising and propaganda that most people have become slaves to it. They can make people pull out their wallets without even thinking in order to buy things they don‚Äôt need to eat, don‚Äôt need to have, and don‚Äôt need to use. This is so commonplace that we absolutely must offer the principle of the Kalama Sutta to our human comrades of this era. (file:///Users/macuser/Dropbox/Bhikkhu%20Buddhadasa/Help,%20Kalama%20Sutta,%20Help!.htm)\n\n## Determinism\n\n  Yes, everything happens by itself, in the sense that there is no \"doer\" independent of the process. However, this absolutely does not mean that things are deterministic. The world as shown by a century of explorations in physical science is probablistic, not deterministic.\n  Everything preceding the present moment is at least to our knowledge unchangeable. However, the present moment is a moment of uncertainty, in which the \"transient self\" that comes into being in this present moment is operating from a place of uncertainty, which gives them the lattitude to make choices that alter the future. And the way we pull ourself up by our bootstraps is to take advantage of that. We do our best as we gain knowledge and understanding in every moment to steer the probabilities in the direction of wisdom, virtue, awakening and compassion.\n\n[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMindIlluminated/comments/558se5/hi_i_am_upasaka_culadasa_john_yates_phd_author_of/d88nnoj/?context=3)\n\n\n- - - -\n\nAs a result one develops the clear seeing that the observed phenomena is pervaded by the three ‚Äúmarks of existence‚Äù: impermanence (annica), insatisfactoriness (dukkha) and emptiness of self (annata).

And that \"letting go\" leads to, or is, nirvana: For once the devotee realizes that there is nothing that he can do then there is nothing left to be done. Thus a philosophical argument leads to rational insight and that insight leads to, or is, nirvana (Page 5) \n- The impatient critic might ask at this juncture: what is the point of all the Buddhist texts, philosophies, theories, and injunctions, if at the end we are told merely, 'Let it all go'? The point, of course, is that these were all necessary to bring one to the realization that they are not at all necessary to nirvana-something the devotee could not know until he had been through all the texts, philosophies, theories, and injunctions. As a child and before I could walk I had to toddle (if that is what toddlers do), and before I could toddle I had to crawl. I do not cry out with impatience, \"Why did I have to crawl and toddle? Why could not I have walked to begin with?\" (Page 5) \n-  the paradox had to be experienced before escape from it was possible (Page 5) \n-  The philosophic realization was necessary before the rational insight was possible, and that rational insight, namely, that there is no way out, was necessary before \"letting go\" could occur, and \"letting go\" was necessary before nirvana was possible (Page 5)","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.063574484Z","tags":null},"/Buddhism/Karma":{"title":"Karma","content":"Karma means action, work, or deed. \nThe term also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect, often descriptively called the principle of karma, wherein intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect): good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and happier rebirths, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and bad rebirths.\n\nHowever, my own interpretation of karma, is that Karma is like gravity.\nIt does not mean that if you do good, you will get good.\nIt means that, if something good or bad happens to you, and you become it, and then pass it along, then it will return to you.\nTake for example a day at work where a co-worker spends their day complaining.

We look for what abilities we have in order to gain a happiness we want. Those abilities are then ours. The hand we can use to reach for the object we want is our hand; the loud voice we can use to scare off the bullies threatening our sister is our voice. This is why the element of control is so essential to our sense of self: We assume that the things we can control are us or ours. Then we also try to think about which part of ourselves will live to enjoy the happiness we're trying to gain. These things will change depending on the desire.\n\nUnfortunately, our desires tend to be confused and incoherent. We're also unskillful in our understanding of what happiness is. Thus we often end up with an inconsistent and misinformed collection of selves. You can see this clearly as you meditate: You find that the mind contains many different inner voices expressing many conflicting opinions as to what you should and shouldn't be doing to be happy.\n\nIt's as if you have a committee inside the mind, and the committee is rarely in order. That's because it's composed of selves you've collected from all your past strategies for trying to gain happiness, and these strategies often worked at cross-purposes. Some of them seemed to work at a time when your standards for happiness were crude, or you weren't really paying attention to the results you were getting ‚Äî as when you threw a tantrum and got your mother to give you the food you wanted. These members of the committee tend to be deluded. Some of your strategies involved doing things you liked to do but actually led to suffering ‚Äî as when you hit your sister and got your toy truck back. These members of the committee tend to be dishonest and deceitful: They deny the suffering they caused. This is why your committee of selves is not an orderly gathering of saints. It's more like a corrupt city council.\n\n[Source:](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/selvesnotself.html#talk1)\n\nThe Buddha understood that the issues of our life are defined by our questions. A question gives a context to the knowledge contained in its answer ‚Äî a sense of where that knowledge fits and what it's good for. Some questions are skillful in that they provide a useful context for putting an end to suffering, whereas others are not. Once, one of the Buddha's monks came to see him and asked him a list of ten questions, the major philosophical questions of his time. Some of the questions concerned the nature of the world, whether it was eternal or not, finite or not; others concerned the nature and existence of the self. The Buddha refused to answer any of them, and he explained the reason for his refusal. He said it was as if a man had been shot by an arrow and was taken to a doctor, and before the doctor could take the arrow out, the man would insist that he find out first who had shot the arrow, who had made the arrow, what the arrow was made of, what kind of wood, what kind of feathers. As the Buddha said, if the doctor tried to answer all of those questions, the man would die first. The first order of business would be to take the arrow out [¬ß3]. If the person still wanted to know the answer to those questions, he could ask afterwards.\n\n\nUsually when we hear the teaching on not-self, we think that it's an answer to questions like these: \"Do I have a self? What am I? Do I exist? Do I not exist?\" However, the Buddha listed all of these as unskillful questions \n\nSo, to repeat, the issue is not, \"What is my true self?\" but \"What kind of perception of self is skillful and when is it skillful, what kind of perception of not-self is skillful and when is it skillful?\"\n\nNormally we create a sense of self as a strategy for gaining happiness. We look for what abilities we have in order to gain a happiness we want. Those abilities are then ours. The hand we can use to reach for the object we want is our hand; the loud voice we can use to scare off the bullies threatening our sister is our voice. This is why the element of control is so essential to our sense of self: We assume that the things we can control are us or ours. Then we also try to think about which part of ourselves will live to enjoy the happiness we're trying to gain. These things will change depending on the desire.","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.063574484Z","tags":null},"/Buddhism/Suffering":{"title":"Suffering","content":"---\n\n  _Dukkha_ is a Pali word, which appears in Sanskrit as _du·∏•kha_, and it is most often translated as ‚Äúpain,‚Äù ‚Äúsuffering,‚Äù ‚Äústress,‚Äù or ‚Äúdis-ease‚Äù (and as an adjective, ‚Äúpainful, stressful‚Äù). The concept of _dukkha_ is one of the fundamental teachings of Buddhism.\n  \n  The Four Noble Truths refer to and express the basic orientation of Buddhism in a short expression: we crave and cling to impermanent states and things, which are dukkha, \"incapable of satisfying\" and painful. This craving keeps us caught in samsara,the endless cycle of repeated rebirth and dying again, and the dukkha that comes with it.\n\n  It is because we see ourselves as separate from other things that we desire them, or are repulsed by them.\n  All emotions are pain because they involve dualism.\n  \n  [Buddhism -- Suffering in Christianity](notes/Buddhism/Buddhism%20--%20Suffering%20in%20Christianity.md)","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.063574484Z","tags":null},"/Buddhism/TODO":{"title":"TODO","content":"### Topics to explore\n-   Buddhist concepts to look into\n    -   Vipassana\n    -   Brahmavihara\n    -   The Headless Way\n    -   anapanasati\n    -   https://www.theknowledgebase.com/archive/en/aci03-1994-newyork-geshemichael/\n    -   http://www.theknowledgebasearchive.com/files/teachings/aci03/aci03-materials.pdf\n    -   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths\n-   Meditation: Ted LEMON\n    -   After every meditation ask questions\n        -   Did I achieve my goal?\n        -   Did I face any obstacles?\n    \n    -   Stage 3: U mostly remember that u forget\n    -   Stage 4: U get distracted / sleepy\n    -   Stage 5: Subtle distraction\n    \n    -   On next sit, you read what you wrote last time.\n    -   Before the session starts\n        -   Doing the mindful review\n        -   4 stages transition\n        -   Intention setting\n        -   Review everything that might come up during the session\n        -   What did I do well?

Arising and Passing away (A\u0026P)\n\n  From that point forward you know with absolute certainty that there is something real about all this meditation stuff. That it isn‚Äôt just relaxation or self-hypnosis. That there really is something deep and wonderful about this practice, and to a larger extent, something beautiful and mysterious about life itself ‚Äì and that you have directly touched it. It is as if you have discovered a secret world that is hidden right within the normal everyday world.\n\n  Along with this discovery comes another one: there have been a vast number of people who have had this experience throughout history, and they come from every conceivable background. This is not a Buddhist thing. It‚Äôs not even a meditation thing. It‚Äôs part of the human experience. You have simply followed one of many paths that lead to it. \n  \n  You begin to appreciate the pointers they left behind for others to find, as cryptic as they first appear, and you feel a grateful connection across time with these generous teachers. \n  \n  In ancient meditation manuals like the Visudimagga insight meditation does not actually begin until one reaches the A\u0026P. It is considered the initial step into Vipassana. Once one has crossed this threshold they have traversed into very rarified territory that is strange and nothing like normal meditation. Up until this point the meditation actually seemed quite mundane, required quite a bit of self-discipline and effort, and was frequently boring or even unpleasant. It was mostly a lot of work. Sort of like running each morning: for a while it is very difficult and you have to force yourself to do it, but at some point a wonderful thing happens and the running seems to do itself. Long-time runners might consider this to be the time when they really became a ‚Äúrunner.‚Äù\n  \n# III. Dark Night (Knowledge of Suffering)\n\n## Dissolution\n\n  I can be a fairly hyperactive and over-committed person in general, and during this stage it was as if I was given a mild tranquilizer. I slowed down physically and mentally and took my time about everything. I found that I had trouble keeping up with things that normally were not a problem. There was a vague sense of the impermanence of things, and I wanted to savor life.\n  \n## Fear\n\n  I say all this to point out that you can easily confuse yourself and become a bit paranoid during this stage if you keep looking outside yourself for the source of fear. The fear was caused by the meditation and not the dog. When I opened my eyes to take a look, the dog was chasing a squirrel.\n  \n  Acceptance\n  \n# IV. Equanimity\n\n  Along with this vibratory quality it is not unusual for meditators to experience lights and other similar phenomena that are like the A\u0026P. Rather than be fascinated by them, you will simply notice that they too are vibrating.\n  \n  Three Characteristics. The mind can focus on the fact that:\n  - The stuff you are aware of is clearly not you\n  - that everything is impermanent and whizzing in and out of existence\n  - it can focus on the characteristic that doing anything except letting go of any of it is very uncomfortable.\n  \n  The reason why the three characteristics are so important is that in these final moments before complete cessation they are the only things that are stable enough to be taken as objects.\n  \n# V. Cessation\n\nSo far on the path, there has been a gradual development of insight and letting go of everything you once thought of as ‚Äúme.‚Äù \n\n1. You began in a small way, looking at body sensations and thoughts and seeing them clearly as different but interdependent phenomena that aren‚Äôt really ‚Äúme‚Äù (physio-cognitive stage). \n2. You then experienced rapturous joy and peak experiences as everything arose and passed away on its own (A\u0026P)\n3. Then sunk down into the lowest lows as you discovered that nothing lasts and nothing can really be held onto (Dark Night). \n4. Now you are watching as all of reality wavers in and out of existence before you (Equanimity).\n\n\n  During the moment of cessation you were utterly gone, and yet there was an awareness there to witness it happen. What does that mean? In Buddhism, as well as other contemplative traditions, the interpretation of this has been an issue of deep debate among the great mystics and masters. Whole lineages and traditions have clashed on differing understandings of this deepest dharma. Is emptiness really empty? Is everything awareness? \n\n  For an instant you were there, then you ‚Äúwent out‚Äù, and yet you have a memory of it happening. \n  \n  As this process unfolds for you, you will get an insight into how profound conditioning really is. You get an intuitive sense that you are programmed to look outside yourself for solutions to things that happen within you, and upon reflection you realize that this is the result of thousands upon thousands of interactions with a world that keeps promising to deliver happiness if you simply know what to do. This very moment, and your reactions to it, are conditioned by everything that came before it, and not seeing or understanding the misleading trends in these conditions is a prison we are all in. But now you have had your first peek outside the prison, and you know for certain that there is a way out.","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.063574484Z","tags":null},"/Buddhism/The-three-evils":{"title":"The 3 Evils","content":"| Greed        | Hate          | Ignorance     |\n|:--           |:--            |:--            |\n| Lust         | Anger         | Confusion     |\n| Desire       | Aversion      | Bewilderment  |\n| Thirst       | Irritation    | Perplexity    |\n| Craving      | Indignation   | Uncertainty   |\n| Yearning     | Resentment    | Doubt         |\n| Longing      | Opposition    | Skepticism    |\n| Wishing      | Contrariety   | Hesitancy     |\n| Hoping       | Impatience    | Indecision    |\n| Liking       | Intolerance   | Oblivion      |\n| Attraction   | Stubbornness  | Stupefaction  |\n| Tendency     | Rigidity      | Obscurity     |\n\n*More:*\n- http://dhammatalks.net/samahita/The_3_Roots.htm\n- http://www.japanese-buddhism.com/three-evils.html\n- http://jendhamuni.com/buddhism/articles/evilroots.htmG","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.063574484Z","tags":null},"/Buddhism/sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra":{"title":"Samsara","content":"Sa·πÉsƒÅra (Sanskrit, Pali; also samsara) in [üß† Buddhist Philosophy|Buddhism](notes/Buddhism/Buddhism.md) and Hinduism is the beginningless cycle of repeated birth, mundane existence and dying again.

This is a built in mechanic where if the total earned from the borrower's interest is lower than the amount needed to pay depositors, there's a minimum yield of 18% that's paid (side note: it should be 18% so I'm not sure why it's slightly lower than 18%). If the total earned from borrower's interest is lower than 18%, we start dipping into the treasury. This 18% minimum yield can be changed through a vote by the community of ANC token holders.\n2.  **UST lost a bit of it's peg.** UST is at 0.98 now which is 2% down, and it's been hanging out there for the last couple of days, while other stablecoins returned to their $1 pegs pretty fast. It's not a big deal, and I expect that it'll return to $1 sooner or later, but it shows that there's a real price variance of 2% that we should expect. Arbitragers need to pay fees too, and earning that 2% only may be too little for the fees they bear, and/or the exposure to a falling LUNA token price.\n3.  **Unsustainability of the 20% returns in a bear market / flash crash scenario.** When LUNA token price crashed, a huge portion of borrowers got liquidated. This does 4 things. a. it reduced the amount of interest being earned by the protocol to pay depositors as there are fewer borrowers paying interest. b. it causes strain on the network, and there was a period of 30 mins where anchor app was down because of it (apparently this is fixed and shouldn't happen again). c. it pisses off the borrowers who may not be back. d. it increased the borrower incentive paid in ANC tokens by a ridiculous amount (currently at 164% APY), which means the supply of ANC tokens is super high now, and with demand low during a bearish period, it could cause ANC to dump.This results in 20% fixed being paid to depositors, but there's not enough flow of capital to make up the 20%. We're currently depleting the reserves, which could finish in a month, and there are two options on the table now: a. reduce the 20% / 18% rates to something more sustainable, or b. use the community pool of ANC to supplement the reserves. Doing (a) would indicate a failure of the protocol in promising 20% returns, and doing (b) would just cause another flood of ANC tokens into the market, which people may see as worthless if the protocol itself can't hold up on it's own.\n4.  **Depositors funds are safe.** Aside from the 2% loss in the UST peg which I expect to be short-term, the depositors funds are safe. Even if the economic model fails, I believe that the initial capital would still be there, and if the anchor rate drops to something more sustainable like 10%, you could always choose to park your money elsewhere.We'll see how it holds up over the next month and moving forward. There's still hope and we'll see the resilience of the protocol during this tumultuous period. :)\n5.  Assuming the protocol holds up and can pay 20% returns, **Nexus Mutual now has coverage for Anchor Protocol**, which is at about 6.11% per year (meaning net 12-14% APY after coverage). The coverage doesn't cover the risk of UST losing it's peg though, so bear that in mind.\n\n\n### Updated review, 4 months later\nAnchor has been running smoothly, borrow side APY is down to more sustainable levels, yield reserves have start accumulating and the protocol is stable for now. I expect this to continue until the next bear market or black swan event. At that point the above will probably repeat, but the protocol should still hold up.","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.063574484Z","tags":null},"/CFD/Arbitrage":{"title":"Arbitrage","content":"Arbitrage is a delta neutral style of trading that seeks to profit from innefficient in the markets, without speculating on the direction of the price.\nThus offer free returns at little cost.\n\n#### Arbitrage ideas\n+ Stablecoin arbitrage\n+ Spot-Futures arbitrage","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.063574484Z","tags":null},"/CFD/Automated-Market-Making-AMM":{"title":"Automated Market Making (AMM)","content":"Automated Market Making incentivizes users to become liquidity providers, in exchange of sharing the transaction fee.\n\n#TODO needs heavy extension\n\nTopics of cover:\n+ [Impermanent loss](https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22)\n+ [Impermanent gain?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nm9mo6/liquidity_staking_as_a_hedge_against_a_shortterm/)\n\nPools:\n+ https://www.binance.com/en/swap/pool\n+ https://app.apy.vision/liquidity-pools\n+ https://zapper.fi/invest\n\n#### Further reading\n+ [Automated Asset Management Protocol](https://medium.com/enzymefinance/automating-asset-management-protocol-8ff400c4f86b)","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.119574561Z","tags":null},"/CFD/Betterment":{"title":"Betterment","content":"Betterment is a robo-advisor specialized in the traditional financial world.\nI Feb 2022, it acquired [Makara](notes/Passive%20Income/Makara.md) in order to expand into crypto offerings","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.119574561Z","tags":null},"/CFD/CFD":{"title":"üêÆ Crypto Farm Dubai","content":"Crypto Farm Dubai (CFD), is a innovative robo-advisor specialized in crypto [Passive Income](notes/Passive%20Income/Passive%20Income.md).\nInvestors select their risk profile and customize their capital allocation among the proposed models.\nCFD then takes care of investing, balancing, and keeping up to date with passive income sources of revenue.\n\n```\nKey Takeaway\n+ Crypto Farm Dubai (CFD) is a crypto robo advisor\n+ CFD Specializes in passive income models\n+ Users allocate their capital on buckets with different risk profiles\n+ CFD takes care of executing, and keeping up to date with latest tech trends\n```\n\n### Types of investments models\n1.

And, the more the user is willing to up his risk profile, the higher the returns are, but so are the risks.\n\nHowever, even for very safe passive incomes such as lending stable coins, the investor faces a series of challenges.\nThe biggest challenge is also what makes crypto so attractive: The user is, and remains, the ultimate decision maker on what happens to his money. NOT the bank, or some wall guarded investment advisor.\n\n```\nKey Takeaways\n+ Passive income allows investors to earn income with little to no risk to principal\n+ Crypto Passive income requires sharp understanding of the techniques, tools, and markets. The investor also needs to remain up to date at all times.\n+ The current solutions do not offer an easy, hands off exposure to crypto passive income\n```\n\n\n### How to make passive income\nWe identify three categories of passive income strategies, categories by the risk taken. Note that riskier strategies, while on the surface look like they generate free money, they bear a risk of loss of capital (sometimes very high):\n1. Safe Strategies\n\t1. [Lending StableCoins](notes/Passive%20Income/Lending%20StableCoins.md)\n\t2. Lending already owned CryptoCoins\n\t3. Liquidity Providing\n\t4. Mining POW chains\n2. Riskier Strategies\n\t1.

Rewards\n\n### Challenges \nAn investor with no financial education, who wishes to generate passive income,  faces a few critical challenges:\n1. Deciding on what allocation to do for each strategy\n2. Deciding on which platform to execute the strategy\n3. Deciding which token to choose for each strategy\n4. Deciding when to rebalance the portfolio between strategies\n5. Executing the different strategies. Some being too complex for the unaware user.\n6. Keeping up to date with new rising opportunities.\n\n### Current solutions\nThere are, in the DeFi world, a number of projects that offer aggregation of solutions between liquidity providers and farms. Such projects are:\n+ [Popsicle.Finance](notes/Passive%20Income/Popsicle.Finance.md)\n+ [Popcorn.Network](notes/Passive%20Income/Popcorn.Network.md)\n+

[Olympus.Finance](notes/Passive%20Income/Olympus.Finance.md)\n\n\nHowever, it still is up to the user to decide which pool to get into, when to rebalance to another one, and more important, how to hedge their coins against potential market drops.\n\n### What's missing\nThere exists, in the traditional finance world, [Robo-advisor](notes/Passive%20Income/Robo-advisor.md) which abstract all the decision-making out of the user, and instead offer the investor with an interface where they select their risk profile, according to which cash is allocated.\nThey are essentially automated [Financial

individual strategy does, or, indeed, which strategy would be added or removed in the future.\nHowever, there are no mature and established robo advisors specialized in crypto.\nThe traditional robo-advisors such as [Betterment](notes/Passive%20Income/Betterment.md) or [WealthFront](https://www.wealthfront.com) are indeed trying to offer crypto solution.\nBut, they are often limited

This is a built in mechanic where if the total earned from the borrower's interest is lower than the amount needed to pay depositors, there's a minimum yield of 18% that's paid (side note: it should be 18% so I'm not sure why it's slightly lower than 18%). If the total earned from borrower's interest is lower than 18%, we start dipping into the treasury. This 18% minimum yield can be changed through a vote by the community of ANC token holders.\n2.  **UST lost a bit of it's peg.** UST is at 0.98 now which is 2% down, and it's been hanging out there for the last couple of days, while other stablecoins returned to their $1 pegs pretty fast. It's not a big deal, and I expect that it'll return to $1 sooner or later, but it shows that there's a real price variance of 2% that we should expect. Arbitragers need to pay fees too, and earning that 2% only may be too little for the fees they bear, and/or the exposure to a falling LUNA token price.\n3.  **Unsustainability of the 20% returns in a bear market / flash crash scenario.** When LUNA token price crashed, a huge portion of borrowers got liquidated. This does 4 things. a. it reduced the amount of interest being earned by the protocol to pay depositors as there are fewer borrowers paying interest. b. it causes strain on the network, and there was a period of 30 mins where anchor app was down because of it (apparently this is fixed and shouldn't happen again). c. it pisses off the borrowers who may not be back. d. it increased the borrower incentive paid in ANC tokens by a ridiculous amount (currently at 164% APY), which means the supply of ANC tokens is super high now, and with demand low during a bearish period, it could cause ANC to dump.This results in 20% fixed being paid to depositors, but there's not enough flow of capital to make up the 20%. We're currently depleting the reserves, which could finish in a month, and there are two options on the table now: a. reduce the 20% / 18% rates to something more sustainable, or b. use the community pool of ANC to supplement the reserves. Doing (a) would indicate a failure of the protocol in promising 20% returns, and doing (b) would just cause another flood of ANC tokens into the market, which people may see as worthless if the protocol itself can't hold up on it's own.\n4.  **Depositors funds are safe.** Aside from the 2% loss in the UST peg which I expect to be short-term, the depositors funds are safe. Even if the economic model fails, I believe that the initial capital would still be there, and if the anchor rate drops to something more sustainable like 10%, you could always choose to park your money elsewhere.We'll see how it holds up over the next month and moving forward. There's still hope and we'll see the resilience of the protocol during this tumultuous period. :)\n5.  Assuming the protocol holds up and can pay 20% returns, **Nexus Mutual now has coverage for Anchor Protocol**, which is at about 6.11% per year (meaning net 12-14% APY after coverage).

And, the more the user is willing to up his risk profile, the higher the returns are, but so are the risks.\n\nHowever, even for very safe passive incomes such as lending stable coins, the investor faces a series of challenges.\nThe biggest challenge is also what makes crypto so attractive: The user is, and remains, the ultimate decision maker on what happens to his money. NOT the bank, or some wall guarded investment advisor.\n\n```\nKey Takeaways\n+ Passive income allows investors to earn income with little to no risk to principal\n+ Crypto Passive income requires sharp understanding of the techniques, tools, and markets. The investor also needs to remain up to date at all times.\n+ The current solutions do not offer an easy, hands off exposure to crypto passive income\n```\n\n\n### How to make passive income\nWe identify three categories of passive income strategies, categories by the risk taken. Note that riskier strategies, while on the surface look like they generate free money, they bear a risk of loss of capital (sometimes very high):\n1. Safe Strategies\n\t1. [Lending StableCoins](notes/Passive%20Income/Lending%20StableCoins.md)\n\t2. Lending already owned CryptoCoins\n\t3. Liquidity Providing\n\t4. Mining POW chains\n2. Riskier Strategies\n\t1. [Staking](notes/Passive%20Income/Staking.md) CryptoCoins\n\t2. Yield Farming\n\t3. Investment in ICO's\n3. Special events\n\t1. Airdops\n\t2. Forks\n\t3. Burns\n\t4. BuyBacks\n\t5. Rewards\n\n### Challenges \nAn investor with no financial education, who wishes to generate passive income,  faces a few critical challenges:\n1. Deciding on what allocation to do for each strategy\n2. Deciding on which platform to execute the strategy\n3. Deciding which token to choose for each strategy\n4. Deciding when to rebalance the portfolio between strategies\n5. Executing the different strategies. Some being too complex for the unaware user.\n6. Keeping up to date with new rising opportunities.\n\n### Current solutions\nThere are, in the DeFi world, a number of projects that offer aggregation of solutions between liquidity providers and farms. Such projects are:\n+ [Popsicle.Finance](notes/Passive%20Income/Popsicle.Finance.md)\n+ [Popcorn.Network](notes/Passive%20Income/Popcorn.Network.md)\n+ [Yearn.Finance](notes/Passive%20Income/Yearn.Finance.md)\n+ [Abracadabra.Finance](notes/Passive%20Income/Abracadabra.Finance.md)\n+ [Olympus.Finance](notes/Passive%20Income/Olympus.Finance.md)\n\n\nHowever, it still is up to the user to decide which pool to get into, when to rebalance to another one, and more important, how to hedge their coins against potential market drops.\n\n### What's missing\nThere exists, in the traditional finance world, [Robo-advisor](notes/Passive%20Income/Robo-advisor.md) which abstract all the decision-making out of the user, and instead offer the investor with an interface where they select their risk profile, according to which cash is allocated.\nThey are essentially automated [Financial advisors](notes/Passive%20Income/Financial%20advisors.md).\nThe advantage for the user is that they don't have to worry about anything.\nBut, it does come at a loss of freedom to pick what each individual strategy does, or, indeed, which strategy would be added or removed in the future.\nHowever, there are no mature and established robo advisors specialized in crypto.\nThe traditional robo-advisors such as [Betterment](notes/Passive%20Income/Betterment.md) or [WealthFront](https://www.wealthfront.com) are indeed trying to offer crypto solution.\nBut, they are often limited geographically, and their minimum capital aren't always easy for all

This is the typical understanding of happiness (Happiness of slavery). In the Dhamma sense, however, happiness is when there is no hunger or want at all, when we're completely free of all hunger, desire, and want. (Happiness of Freedom)\n  \nOur sense of happiness is so brittle, it can be destroyed simply by asking whether or not it exists.\n\n# Happiness\n\n## The 2 happiness\n\nImagine, if you can, that you are the sole owner of the world, of the universe, of the entire cosmos. Now that you're the owner of everything, does hunger stop? Can it stop? Would you please examine this carefully with and in your own mind. If you were to get everything that you could possibly desire, to the point that you owned the whole world, would your hunger cease? Or would you hunger for a second universe? Would you want a third?\n\nConsider the fact that hunger never ends by our attempts to satisfy it. In spite of this, the world today continues to develop the kind of education and evolution that seek merely to produce things which are more lovely and satisfying. Modern technology and science are slaves of hunger. Our world is falling into this deep hole of endlessly producing increasingly seductive things to try to satisfy hunger. But where are you going to find happiness in such a world?\n\n**Example:**\n\n    The new-born infant is happy when it is cuddled in its mother's arms and sucks milk from her breast. This satisfies the infant until it grows a little older, a little bigger. Then the mother's arms and breast aren‚Äôt enough. It learns about other foods and delights. Now its happiness depends on ice cream, candy, and junk food, on playing little games and running around the house. Then it grows older and those games don't satisfy the child any more. It wants to play football or play with dolls. These two are outgrown eventually and the teenager's interests and happiness revolve around sex. The previous kinds of satisfaction are of no more interest. When they become young men and women, don't expect them to be satisfied with the old types of happiness. Now, all they think about is sex and dates. Finally, the human being marries, becomes a wife or husband, and has hopes and wishes tied up in a house, money, and possessions. There's no way they can be satisfied with childish happiness (unless they haven't really grown up) The human being changes from stage to stage, and happiness also changes from stage to stage. It is continuous and endless. Hunger develops from stage to stage until death. After that, many believe, there is rebirth as a deva (celestial being, like angels): and still there's hunger, heavenly hunger for the happiness of devas. It never stops. Even in heaven with the gods or in the kingdom of God, should such things exist, hunger doesn't stop. In Buddhism these all are considered to be examples of worldly happiness that only deceives and confuses.    \n\n## When does hunger stop?\n\nWe must take this other path where there is no hunger. The essence of this path is the absence of the feeling of self, of \"I\" and \"mine\". \n\nIt is necessary to realize this connection between the end of hunger and the cessation of the self illusion. \n\nHunger persists as this self seeks to acquire things for itself without ever truly succeeding. \n\nWe desire one kind of 'the best', but as soon as we get it our hunger reaches after a better 'the best'. This has no end as long as there's self that wants 'the best‚Äô. Through our grasping at \"the best\" we're burdened also with \"the worst\". \n\nTo be free of all *dukkha*, the mind must be beyond good and evil, above best and worst-that is , it must dwell in voidness.  In voidness hunger stops and there is true happiness.\n\n## The Tree of Knowledge\n\nThose of you who are Christians or who have read the Bible will be familiar with the story of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that appears at the beginning of Genesis. It tells how God forbade Adam and Eve to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. He warned them that they would die if they did not obey. If you understand the meaning of this passage, you will understand the core of Buddhism. When there is no knowledge of good and evil, we can't attach to them, we're void and free of dukkha. Once we know about good and evil, we attach to them and must suffer dukkha. The fruit of that tree is this attachment to good and evil. This causes dukkha and dukkha is death, spiritual death.\n\nWe identify things as good and attach to them. We identify things as bad and detach from them. We are trapped in worldly conditions by our dualistic obsession with good and bad. This is the death of which God warned. Will you heed his warning?\n\nThe Buddhist solution is to be above good and evil to be void.\n\nDon't attach to good and evil because they are impermanent (anicca), unsatisfactory (dukkha), and not-self (anatta). Good and evil are anicca, dukkha, anatta. \n\nIf we grasp and cling to \"good\", we are hungry for good. If we have what is the best, we hunger for the best. No matter how \"best\" something is, it still causes hunger. \n\n## Natural vs Unnecessary Hunger\n\nThe body instinctually feels hunger regarding its natural needs: clothing, food, shelter, medicine, exercise. This kind of hunger is no problem. It doesn't cause dukkha and can be satisfied without causing dukkha.\n\nThen, there is the second kind of hunger, which is mental, that we call \"*spiritual hunger*\". This is the hunger of thinking born out of attachment. Spiritual hunger, being tied up with ignorance (avijja) and attachment (upadana), destroys the coolness and calm of the mind, which is true happiness and peace, thus bringing dukkha.\n\n\u003e Through attachment the human mind knows spiritual hunger.\n\nThe body has a nervous system. When it lacks something that it needs there arises a certain activity which we call \"hunger\". That's all there is to it -- tathata. Don't let it cook up into spiritual hunger by attaching to it as \"my hunger\" or the \"I who hunger\".\n\nWhen the body is hungry, eat mindfully and wisely. Then physical hunger won't disturb the mind.\n\n# Emptiness\n\nWe cannot get rid of suffering by saying, \"I will not suffer.\" We cannot eliminate attachment by saying, \"I will not be attached to anything,\" nor eliminate aggression by saying, \"I will never become angry.\" Yet, we do want to get rid of suffering and the disturbing emotions that are the immediate cause of suffering. \nThe Buddha taught that to eliminate these states, which are really the results of the primary confusion of our belief in a personal self, we must get rid of the fundamental cause. \nBut we cannot simply say, \"I will not believe in the personal self.\" The only way to eliminate suffering is to actually recognize the experience of a self as a misconception, which we do by proving directly to ourselves that there is no such personal self. We must actually realise this. Once we do, then automatically the misconception of a self and our fixation on that \"self\" will disappear. \nOnly by directly experiencing selflessness can we end the process of confused projection. This is why the Buddha emphasized meditation on selflessness or egolessness (emptiness). \nHowever, to meditate on egolessness, we must undertake a process that begins with a conceptual understanding of egolessness; then, based on that understanding, there can be meditation, and finally realization.\n\nInstead of focusing on differences and individuality, the realisation of emptiness is about realising that nothing exists by itself alone, but depends on other things. Just as all living beings rely on other living beings - at least their ancestors, so do even inanimate objects depend on other objects, conditions, parts and processes to arise and disappear.\n  \nTo put it simple, our perception of the world is only possible because of interaction, interrelation, dependence and exchange of information.\n  \n## Perception\n\nWhen we perceive an object, we automatically tend to label it (like nice, bad, wet, dry, light, dark, etc.). As soon as our mind puts a label  on an object, the label takes the place of the actual object in our mental processes. As our mental image or label can never represent all the different qualities and characteristics of any object, it is always just a simplified, usually exaggerated, subjective snap shot. However, our mind reacts on the basis of our own mental label of an object. No wonder we tend to react simplistic, exaggerated and subjective in many situations. All perceived objects are conditioned by our senses and our own mind. \nThis leads to the dramatic conclusion that we are not and by definition can never be objective!\n\n- - - -\n\nStop insisting on one-sided positions\n\nThe world nowadays is so overwhelmed by the power of advertising and propaganda that most people have become slaves to it. They can make people pull out their wallets without even thinking in order to buy things they don‚Äôt need to eat, don‚Äôt need to have, and don‚Äôt need to use. This is so commonplace that we absolutely must offer the principle of the Kalama Sutta to our human comrades of this era. (file:///Users/macuser/Dropbox/Bhikkhu%20Buddhadasa/Help,%20Kalama%20Sutta,%20Help!.htm)\n\n## Determinism\n\n  Yes, everything happens by itself, in the sense that there is no \"doer\" independent of the process. However, this absolutely does not mean that things are deterministic. The world as shown by a century of explorations in physical science is probablistic, not deterministic.\n  Everything preceding the present moment is at least to our knowledge unchangeable. However, the present moment is a moment of uncertainty, in which the \"transient self\" that comes into being in this present moment is operating from a place of uncertainty, which gives them the lattitude to make choices that alter the future. And the way we pull ourself up by our bootstraps is to take advantage of that. We do our best as we gain knowledge and understanding in every moment to steer the probabilities in the direction of wisdom, virtue, awakening and compassion.\n\n[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMindIlluminated/comments/558se5/hi_i_am_upasaka_culadasa_john_yates_phd_author_of/d88nnoj/?context=3)\n\n\n- - - -\n\nAs a result one develops the clear seeing that the observed phenomena is pervaded by the three ‚Äúmarks of existence‚Äù: impermanence (annica), insatisfactoriness (dukkha) and emptiness of self (annata).

And that \"letting go\" leads to, or is, nirvana: For once the devotee realizes that there is nothing that he can do then there is nothing left to be done. Thus a philosophical argument leads to rational insight and that insight leads to, or is, nirvana (Page 5) \n- The impatient critic might ask at this juncture: what is the point of all the Buddhist texts, philosophies, theories, and injunctions, if at the end we are told merely, 'Let it all go'? The point, of course, is that these were all necessary to bring one to the realization that they are not at all necessary to nirvana-something the devotee could not know until he had been through all the texts, philosophies, theories, and injunctions. As a child and before I could walk I had to toddle (if that is what toddlers do), and before I could toddle I had to crawl. I do not cry out with impatience, \"Why did I have to crawl and toddle? Why could not I have walked to begin with?\" (Page 5) \n-  the paradox had to be experienced before escape from it was possible (Page 5) \n-  The philosophic realization was necessary before the rational insight was possible, and that rational insight, namely, that there is no way out, was necessary before \"letting go\" could occur, and \"letting go\" was necessary before nirvana was possible (Page 5)","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.175574638Z","tags":null},"/notes/Buddhism/Karma":{"title":"Karma","content":"Karma means action, work, or deed. \nThe term also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect, often descriptively called the principle of karma, wherein intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect): good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and happier rebirths, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and bad rebirths.\n\nHowever, my own interpretation of karma, is that Karma is like gravity.\nIt does not mean that if you do good, you will get good.\nIt means that, if something good or bad happens to you, and you become it, and then pass it along, then it will return to you.\nTake for example a day at work where a co-worker spends their day complaining.

We look for what abilities we have in order to gain a happiness we want. Those abilities are then ours. The hand we can use to reach for the object we want is our hand; the loud voice we can use to scare off the bullies threatening our sister is our voice. This is why the element of control is so essential to our sense of self: We assume that the things we can control are us or ours. Then we also try to think about which part of ourselves will live to enjoy the happiness we're trying to gain. These things will change depending on the desire.\n\nUnfortunately, our desires tend to be confused and incoherent. We're also unskillful in our understanding of what happiness is. Thus we often end up with an inconsistent and misinformed collection of selves. You can see this clearly as you meditate: You find that the mind contains many different inner voices expressing many conflicting opinions as to what you should and shouldn't be doing to be happy.\n\nIt's as if you have a committee inside the mind, and the committee is rarely in order. That's because it's composed of selves you've collected from all your past strategies for trying to gain happiness, and these strategies often worked at cross-purposes. Some of them seemed to work at a time when your standards for happiness were crude, or you weren't really paying attention to the results you were getting ‚Äî as when you threw a tantrum and got your mother to give you the food you wanted. These members of the committee tend to be deluded. Some of your strategies involved doing things you liked to do but actually led to suffering ‚Äî as when you hit your sister and got your toy truck back. These members of the committee tend to be dishonest and deceitful: They deny the suffering they caused. This is why your committee of selves is not an orderly gathering of saints. It's more like a corrupt city council.\n\n[Source:](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/selvesnotself.html#talk1)\n\nThe Buddha understood that the issues of our life are defined by our questions. A question gives a context to the knowledge contained in its answer ‚Äî a sense of where that knowledge fits and what it's good for. Some questions are skillful in that they provide a useful context for putting an end to suffering, whereas others are not. Once, one of the Buddha's monks came to see him and asked him a list of ten questions, the major philosophical questions of his time. Some of the questions concerned the nature of the world, whether it was eternal or not, finite or not; others concerned the nature and existence of the self. The Buddha refused to answer any of them, and he explained the reason for his refusal. He said it was as if a man had been shot by an arrow and was taken to a doctor, and before the doctor could take the arrow out, the man would insist that he find out first who had shot the arrow, who had made the arrow, what the arrow was made of, what kind of wood, what kind of feathers. As the Buddha said, if the doctor tried to answer all of those questions, the man would die first. The first order of business would be to take the arrow out [¬ß3]. If the person still wanted to know the answer to those questions, he could ask afterwards.\n\n\nUsually when we hear the teaching on not-self, we think that it's an answer to questions like these: \"Do I have a self? What am I? Do I exist? Do I not exist?\" However, the Buddha listed all of these as unskillful questions \n\nSo, to repeat, the issue is not, \"What is my true self?\" but \"What kind of perception of self is skillful and when is it skillful, what kind of perception of not-self is skillful and when is it skillful?\"\n\nNormally we create a sense of self as a strategy for gaining happiness.

Arising and Passing away (A\u0026P)\n\n  From that point forward you know with absolute certainty that there is something real about all this meditation stuff. That it isn‚Äôt just relaxation or self-hypnosis. That there really is something deep and wonderful about this practice, and to a larger extent, something beautiful and mysterious about life itself ‚Äì and that you have directly touched it. It is as if you have discovered a secret world that is hidden right within the normal everyday world.\n\n  Along with this discovery comes another one: there have been a vast number of people who have had this experience throughout history, and they come from every conceivable background. This is not a Buddhist thing. It‚Äôs not even a meditation thing. It‚Äôs part of the human experience. You have simply followed one of many paths that lead to it. \n  \n  You begin to appreciate the pointers they left behind for others to find, as cryptic as they first appear, and you feel a grateful connection across time with these generous teachers. \n  \n  In ancient meditation manuals like the Visudimagga insight meditation does not actually begin until one reaches the A\u0026P. It is considered the initial step into Vipassana. Once one has crossed this threshold they have traversed into very rarified territory that is strange and nothing like normal meditation. Up until this point the meditation actually seemed quite mundane, required quite a bit of self-discipline and effort, and was frequently boring or even unpleasant. It was mostly a lot of work. Sort of like running each morning: for a while it is very difficult and you have to force yourself to do it, but at some point a wonderful thing happens and the running seems to do itself. Long-time runners might consider this to be the time when they really became a ‚Äúrunner.‚Äù\n  \n# III. Dark Night (Knowledge of Suffering)\n\n## Dissolution\n\n  I can be a fairly hyperactive and over-committed person in general, and during this stage it was as if I was given a mild tranquilizer. I slowed down physically and mentally and took my time about everything. I found that I had trouble keeping up with things that normally were not a problem. There was a vague sense of the impermanence of things, and I wanted to savor life.\n  \n## Fear\n\n  I say all this to point out that you can easily confuse yourself and become a bit paranoid during this stage if you keep looking outside yourself for the source of fear. The fear was caused by the meditation and not the dog. When I opened my eyes to take a look, the dog was chasing a squirrel.\n  \n  Acceptance\n  \n# IV. Equanimity\n\n  Along with this vibratory quality it is not unusual for meditators to experience lights and other similar phenomena that are like the A\u0026P. Rather than be fascinated by them, you will simply notice that they too are vibrating.\n  \n  Three Characteristics. The mind can focus on the fact that:\n  - The stuff you are aware of is clearly not you\n  - that everything is impermanent and whizzing in and out of existence\n  - it can focus on the characteristic that doing anything except letting go of any of it is very uncomfortable.\n  \n  The reason why the three characteristics are so important is that in these final moments before complete cessation they are the only things that are stable enough to be taken as objects.\n  \n# V. Cessation\n\nSo far on the path, there has been a gradual development of insight and letting go of everything you once thought of as ‚Äúme.‚Äù \n\n1. You began in a small way, looking at body sensations and thoughts and seeing them clearly as different but interdependent phenomena that aren‚Äôt really ‚Äúme‚Äù (physio-cognitive stage). \n2. You then experienced rapturous joy and peak experiences as everything arose and passed away on its own (A\u0026P)\n3. Then sunk down into the lowest lows as you discovered that nothing lasts and nothing can really be held onto (Dark Night). \n4. Now you are watching as all of reality wavers in and out of existence before you (Equanimity).\n\n\n  During the moment of cessation you were utterly gone, and yet there was an awareness there to witness it happen. What does that mean? In Buddhism, as well as other contemplative traditions, the interpretation of this has been an issue of deep debate among the great mystics and masters. Whole lineages and traditions have clashed on differing understandings of this deepest dharma. Is emptiness really empty? Is everything awareness? \n\n  For an instant you were there, then you ‚Äúwent out‚Äù, and yet you have a memory of it happening. \n  \n  As this process unfolds for you, you will get an insight into how profound conditioning really is. You get an intuitive sense that you are programmed to look outside yourself for solutions to things that happen within you, and upon reflection you realize that this is the result of thousands upon thousands of interactions with a world that keeps promising to deliver happiness if you simply know what to do.

This is a built in mechanic where if the total earned from the borrower's interest is lower than the amount needed to pay depositors, there's a minimum yield of 18% that's paid (side note: it should be 18% so I'm not sure why it's slightly lower than 18%). If the total earned from borrower's interest is lower than 18%, we start dipping into the treasury. This 18% minimum yield can be changed through a vote by the community of ANC token holders.\n2.  **UST lost a bit of it's peg.** UST is at 0.98 now which is 2% down, and it's been hanging out there for the last couple of days, while other stablecoins returned to their $1 pegs pretty fast. It's not a big deal, and I expect that it'll return to $1 sooner or later, but it shows that there's a real price variance of 2% that we should expect. Arbitragers need to pay fees too, and earning that 2% only may be too little for the fees they bear, and/or the exposure to a falling LUNA token price.\n3.  **Unsustainability of the 20% returns in a bear market / flash crash scenario.** When LUNA token price crashed, a huge portion of borrowers got liquidated. This does 4 things. a. it reduced the amount of interest being earned by the protocol to pay depositors as there are fewer borrowers paying interest. b. it causes strain on the network, and there was a period of 30 mins where anchor app was down because of it (apparently this is fixed and shouldn't happen again). c. it pisses off the borrowers who may not be back. d. it increased the borrower incentive paid in ANC tokens by a ridiculous amount (currently at 164% APY), which means the supply of ANC tokens is super high now, and with demand low during a bearish period, it could cause ANC to dump.This results in 20% fixed being paid to depositors, but there's not enough flow of capital to make up the 20%. We're currently depleting the reserves, which could finish in a month, and there are two options on the table now: a. reduce the 20% / 18% rates to something more sustainable, or b. use the community pool of ANC to supplement the reserves. Doing (a) would indicate a failure of the protocol in promising 20% returns, and doing (b) would just cause another flood of ANC tokens into the market, which people may see as worthless if the protocol itself can't hold up on it's own.\n4.  **Depositors funds are safe.** Aside from the 2% loss in the UST peg which I expect to be short-term, the depositors funds are safe. Even if the economic model fails, I believe that the initial capital would still be there, and if the anchor rate drops to something more sustainable like 10%, you could always choose to park your money elsewhere.We'll see how it holds up over the next month and moving forward. There's still hope and we'll see the resilience of the protocol during this tumultuous period. :)\n5.  Assuming the protocol holds up and can pay 20% returns, **Nexus Mutual now has coverage for Anchor Protocol**, which is at about 6.11% per year (meaning net 12-14% APY after coverage). The coverage doesn't cover the risk of UST losing it's peg though, so bear that in mind.\n\n\n### Updated review, 4 months later\nAnchor has been running smoothly, borrow side APY is down to more sustainable levels, yield reserves have start accumulating and the protocol is stable for now. I expect this to continue until the next bear market or black swan event. At that point the above will probably repeat, but the protocol should still hold up.","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.179574644Z","tags":null},"/notes/Passive-Income/Arbitrage":{"title":"Arbitrage","content":"Arbitrage is a delta neutral style of trading that seeks to profit from innefficient in the markets, without speculating on the direction of the price.\nThus offer free returns at little cost.\n\n#### Arbitrage ideas\n+ Stablecoin arbitrage\n+ Spot-Futures arbitrage","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.179574644Z","tags":null},"/notes/Passive-Income/Automated-Market-Making-AMM":{"title":"Automated Market Making (AMM)","content":"Automated Market Making incentivizes users to become liquidity providers, in exchange of sharing the transaction fee.\n\n#TODO needs heavy extension\n\nTopics of cover:\n+ [Impermanent loss](https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22)\n+ [Impermanent gain?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nm9mo6/liquidity_staking_as_a_hedge_against_a_shortterm/)\n\nPools:\n+ https://www.binance.com/en/swap/pool\n+ https://app.apy.vision/liquidity-pools\n+ https://zapper.fi/invest\n\n#### Further reading\n+ [Automated Asset Management Protocol](https://medium.com/enzymefinance/automating-asset-management-protocol-8ff400c4f86b)","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.22757471Z","tags":null},"/notes/Passive-Income/Betterment":{"title":"Betterment","content":"Betterment is a robo-advisor specialized in the traditional financial world.\nI Feb 2022, it acquired [Makara](notes/Passive%20Income/Makara.md) in order to expand into crypto offerings","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.22757471Z","tags":null},"/notes/Passive-Income/CFD":{"title":"üêÆ Crypto Farm Dubai","content":"Crypto Farm Dubai (CFD), is a innovative robo-advisor specialized in crypto [Passive Income](notes/Passive%20Income/Passive%20Income.md).\nInvestors select their risk profile and customize their capital allocation among the proposed models.\nCFD then takes care of investing, balancing, and keeping up to date with passive income sources of revenue.\n\n```\nKey Takeaway\n+ Crypto Farm Dubai (CFD) is a crypto robo advisor\n+ CFD Specializes in passive income models\n+ Users allocate their capital on buckets with different risk profiles\n+ CFD takes care of executing, and keeping up to date with latest tech trends\n```\n\n### Types of investments models\n1.

hedge their coins against potential market drops.\n\n### What's missing\nThere exists, in the traditional finance world, [Robo-advisor](notes/Passive%20Income/Robo-advisor.md) which abstract all the decision-making out of the user, and instead offer the investor with an interface where they select their risk profile, according to which cash is allocated.\nThey are essentially automated [Financial advisors](notes/Passive%20Income/Financial%20advisors.md).\nThe advantage for the user is that they don't have to worry about anything.\nBut, it does come at a loss of freedom to pick what each individual strategy does, or, indeed, which strategy would be added or removed in the future.\nHowever, there are no mature and established robo advisors specialized in crypto.\nThe traditional robo-advisors such as [Betterment](notes/Passive%20Income/Betterment.md) or [WealthFront](https://www.wealthfront.com) are indeed trying to offer crypto solution.\nBut, they are often limited geographically, and their minimum capital aren't always easy for all users.","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.22757471Z","tags":null},"/notes/Passive-Income/Popcorn.Network":{"title":"Popcorn.Network","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.22757471Z","tags":null},"/notes/Passive-Income/Popsicle.Finance":{"title":"Popsicle.Finance","content":"https://medium.com/@james_gaps/popsicle-finance-an-in-depth-crypto-review-c2d7de227b8d","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.22757471Z","tags":null},"/notes/Passive-Income/Portfolio-Tracking":{"title":"Portfolio

And it draws heavily on a multitude of techniques from different buddhist traditions without championing one idea over another in particular.\n\nI originally started reading the book in 2017 when I wanted to acquire more focus and concentration at work.\nTo this day, i keep on revising the book because as my meditation practice matures, some elements become more obvious today.\n\n## The 10 stages\nThe stages can be simplified in the following:\n1. Establish the practice\n2. 'Aha' moments when attention recognizes it lost focus on the breath\n3. Less forgetting, mind wandering and sleepiness\n4. Purifications and overcoming gross distractions\n5. Sustain or even increase the power of mindfulness\n6. [Metacognitive Introspective Awareness](ysfdwtmo)\n7. Jhanas and [Insight (VipassanƒÅ)](tpi5wwns)\n8. Pacification of sense, and rise of meditative joy\n9. Tranquitlity and [Equanimity](2ou0gfth) replacing joy\n10. Effortless stable attention, mindfulness, joy, tranquility, and equanimity persist away from the cushion\n\n\nThe stages are not sequential, and thus it is possible for anyone to have an experience of an advances stage.\nHowever, that experience might not be sustainable due to the lack of experience.\n\nInstead, it's best for us meditators to recognize in which stage we most likely are, in order to recognize the challenges we are most likely to face, and best practice to deal with them.\nFor example, I remember when I went over stage 4, I experienced random moments of joy and sadness during the way, without any underlying explanation.\nTurned out, this is called purification. It is the result of the [Mindfulness](fzngle24) muscle working on its own outside of the meditation practice. Thus, on an unconscious level, memories are being processed.\nIn this case, it is best to do less [mindfulness](fzngle24) meditation, and instead explore [analytical meditation](g2lj5miv).\nThis is a style of meditation where we ask a question and wait and see what answers rises and manifests in consciousness.\nThe goal is to help the unconscious put into words that experience it is having.\n\nWith practice, I discovered that either putting the right word to describe the experience, or finding the exact spot in the body where the experience is expressing itself, provides a great feeling of relief in the face of disturbing emotions.\n\n## The theory\nThe book covert a great deal of buddhist philosophy. While there might be a tendency to read it in one go, it often proved useful to me to take the time to explore what each idea means.\nFor example, the concept of pacification of the mind, or the doctrine of [Impermanence](bwrx09ol), in particular the impermanence of the self. All of these are often relatively short to explain, and yet, experiencing them - in particular the impermanence of the self - can be nerve wrecking experiences.","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.231574715Z","tags":null},"/tmic0p2e":{"title":"Arch linux","content":"Arch Linux.

Lack of body flexibility is the problem.\nSo, I tried doing exercises to reinforce that, but it led to physical pain, leaving me in panic that I might no longer be able to sit in meditation if I were to suffer an injury.\nHowever, this fear calmed down in an instant after a video call with my mother, who showed me which exercise caused my actual pain.\nShe also guided me to do the exercises that would benefit my end goal of cultivating stretching, flexibility, and thus sitting in full lotus during meditation.\n\n### Divergence with Sanghas\n\nAs for the sangha, I have come to be disillusioned by their 'importance', in particular the plum village one.\nThis was obvious this week.\nI went from wanting to be heavily invested in organizing events within the Sangha, into being almost mute during the 8-people gathering on Tuesday that was meant to organize the group!\nThe reason is quite deep, and it comes from a divergence in my reading of what the Sangha is.\nTo make it short, people in both Sanghas I meditate with, do not know of any other Sanghas, and are a bit too fixated on their own practice.\nThere is in each one, a big element of veneration to either the teacher, or the teachings of that particular sangha. (ex. In zen, it is the posture. At plum, it is the 5 mindfulness trading)\nHowever, I find there is a contraction between this, and the 4 noble truth, in particular the second one that stipulated that suffering comes from our *attachment* to **impermanent** things.\n\nYes, I have found refuge in the plum retreat of NYE, because I found like-minded people.\nBut, I also heavily resisted the ceremonial aspect of their practice -- too much herd mentality needed.\nLast week I finally came to understand [The 8-fold path](kxqaql4m) , and with it came an appreciation of [The 3 jewels](82wh78at): The Buddha, the dharma, and finally, the sangha.\n\nHowever, I had an itch annoying me.\nIf the 3 jewels included the sangha, did that mean that the physical presence in a sangha was imperative? If yes, then which? And why this one, not the other? Why this teacher, not another one?\nAnd how does that align with the Zen teaching of \"there is nothing to do?\".\n\nIs it also possible that there be a conflict of interest here?\nMaybe a Sangha considers a Sangha to be a Jewel, in order to find a reason to keep a Sangha alive. After all, the Buddha nature is not bounded by a single person or place. Is it like the force, ever present to the Jedi willing and able to tap into it.\n\nThis internal conflict resulted in me feeling as if I was losing that connection to a meditation community that has been flourishing for the past 2 months.\nBut now, I understand that instead, I didn't lose anything, because there was nothing to lose in the first place!\nFrom the very first day, I got there knowing I did not want to 'belong' anywhere. I went to Zazen for my 'Jedi training', not to do Zazen, for ex.\n\nBut as time passed, it is but normal that the community members would interact with me differently, and I would find value in them. This value creates the fear of loss at the sign of divergence.\nBut, losing what?\nAll I want, and need, is a place to sit and practice meditation as it speaks to *me*, not as it speaks to other.\nThe reality is that no one will ever really know how much progress I am making in my practice. We never actually sit and talk about our own practices and progress in these practices, do we now! (It happened punctually at plum retreat with some bright minds)\n\n### The 3 Jewels\nThe piece of information that I was missing in my understanding of the 3 Jewels, is that both the Buddha and the Sangha do **not** to be physical entities.\nThe Buddha can be a reference to the Buddha nature, such as the force.\nThis nature is manifested when an action is taken that is aligned with the 8-fold path.\nThat's all there is.\n\nAs for the Sangha, let's go back to the definition. It is supposed to be the spiritual community that provides us support on our path to enlightenment.\nGreat, but then does that Sangha need to be a physical one of Buddhist practitioners?\nThis begs two critical questions:\n1. What would a Sangha for lay people who do not want to engage in monastic life? Competitive people, entrepreneurs, and builders who want to go out there in the world and make things?\n2. Which Sangha should one be part of? And as such, what to do if the 'spiritual Sangha' where I live, does not provide deeper support on the path to enlightenment?\n\nI used the second question as a base to reverse engineer the problem: A Sangha can be, but is not necessarily, a community of actual people you meet and spend time with.\nAwakening does not only happen in a Buddhist temple surrounded by Buddhist monks.\nIt is a manifestation of living life in an awakened way, by being close to the 8-fold path.\nRight?\nSo, maybe... a Sangha can be literally any person we are going to interact with.\nThis is the exact same thing as when we do not communicate what is happening during silent meditations.\nIf I am at Carrefour buying grocery, the cashier is offering me the opportunity to smile, be gentle, and respond skillfully and mindfully to potential issues.\nDoing so *is* a sign of enlightenment!","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.231574715Z","tags":null},"/xikhdqga":{"title":"Meditation is not about becoming a monk","content":"---\n\nI consider [meditation](30m0jqb0) to be the art of systematically training the mind üß†.\nThe goal is to make it effortless for me to react to events in life.\n\n# üß† Training\nThe mental image I have of myself meditating is less that of a monk, and more that of a Jedi, or a Samurai.\n\n## The Jedi\nJedis practice meditation in order to reinforce, among other things, their affinity to the force.\nThe force exists in the universe, and the jedi has to figure out how to communicate with it.\nIt is fundamentally outside of his control, and it requires a great deal of giving in, and trust, in order to tap into it.\n\nThe Sith, are the Jedis that allowed fear, anger, and greed to take over.\n\nHowever, I do not like the Jedi as portrayed in movies, because it is too pure and thus unrealistic.\nThey insist too much on the need to resist darkness.\nOn the contrary, there is great deal of learning that can come from sitting with the darkness, and studying it.\n\nI like most the Gray Jedis. My favorite is the last sentence in the Gray jedi code:\n\u003e In life, there is freedom\n\u003e\n\u003e In death, there is purpose\n\nThe part on death is critical to understand, as the cycle of death and rebirth is core to buddhism.\nBecause everything is impermanent, it thus follows that everything dies.\nAs such, the limited resources and time at hand, invite the Jedi to find a meaningful purpose that would drive their actions.\n\nIn life, there are the possibilities seem limitless. Thereby lies the freedom of choice.\nBut, the fact that everything dies, means that the meditator needs to be careful and deliberate about time.\n\n\n## The Samurai and the study of patience\n\nWhat fascinates me in the Samurai is not the martial art, but the discipline and patience.\nDiscipline is obvious. Without it, no warrior can put in the hours to train and become fearless on the battlefield.\n\nHowever patience is less understood, and tends to be neglected.\nI invite you to reflect on this famous quote by Ieyasu Tokugawa:\n\n\u003e There are 7 emotions: Joy, anger, anxiety, adoration, grief, fear, and hate\n\u003e\n\u003e If a man does not give way to these, he can be called patient\n\nThe key is that patience is not in the face of time, but rather emotions.\nThat is true for both happy as well as sad emotions.\n\nThe Samurai is thus invited to study patience.\nTo examine how these emotions rise and fall. To the experienced eye, they are clearly in charge of their life.\n\nThis is exactly what happens during mindfulness meditation where both good and bad emotions challenge the focus on the breath.","lastmodified":"2022-07-29T13:49:29.231574715Z","tags":null},"/ysfdwtmo":{"title":"Metacognitive Introspective Awareness","content":"Metacognitive introspective awareness is essentially the cognition of being aware of your own cognition.\n\nTo break the 3 words down:\n1.
