My favorite is the last sentence in the Gray jedi code:\n\u003e In life, there is freedom\n\u003e\n\u003e In death, there is purpose\n\nThe part on death is critical to understand, as the cycle of death and rebirth is core to buddhism.\nBecause everything is impermanent, it thus follows that everything dies.\nAs such, the limited resources and time at hand, invite the Jedi to find a meaningful purpose that would drive their actions.\n\nIn life, there are the possibilities seem limitless. Thereby lies the freedom of choice.\nBut, the fact that everything dies, means that the meditator needs to be careful and deliberate about time.\n\n\n## The Samurai and the study of patience\n\nWhat fascinates me in the Samurai is not the martial art, but the discipline and patience.\nDiscipline is obvious. Without it, no warrior can put in the hours to train and become fearless on the battlefield.\n\nHowever patience is less understood, and tends to be neglected.\nI invite you to reflect on this famous quote by Ieyasu Tokugawa:\n\n\u003e There are 7 emotions: Joy, anger, anxiety, adoration, grief, fear, and hate\n\u003e\n\u003e If a man does not give way to these, he can be called patient\n\nThe key is that patience is not in the face of time, but rather emotions.\nThat is true for both happy as well as sad emotions.\n\nThe Samurai is thus invited to study patience.\nTo examine how these emotions rise and fall. To the experienced eye, they are obviously in charge of their life.\n\nThis is exactly what happens during mindfulness meditation where both good and bad emotions challenge the focus on the breath.","lastmodified":"2022-04-12T22:08:30.731430364Z","tags":null}}
