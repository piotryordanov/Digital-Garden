The Four Noble Truths is the heart of the Buddhist doctrine. It is not to be believed blindly, but rather, it is an invitation to try and see for oneself.

To sum it up:
1. In life there is suffering, or unsatisfactoriness
2. Caused by our clinging to things, ideas, events etc... that are [impermanent](bwrx09ol)
3. However, happiness does exist. (In traditional texts, it is said that there is an end to the suffering)
4. And that is achieved on the [The 8-fold path](kxqaql4m)
