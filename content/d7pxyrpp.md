I have been programming the web for over a decade now, and I saw how front end frameworks evolved from jQuery, to backbone, ember, angular, and finally React and vue.js.

All of these frameworks aim to make possible the programming of web apps, but they do not approach it the same way.\
What I like most about react, especially ever since hooks were introduced, is that it is now very [functional programming](g0b4j0ek) friendly.
