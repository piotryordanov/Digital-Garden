WSL stands for `Window subsystem for linux`.
After struggling for years with dual-booting, and running linux on inefficient VM's, I finally find myself able to run a full fledge linux distro from the comfort of my windows machine.

The advantage of using windows is that many important software run only on windows.\
This includes most trading softwares and games.

WSL2 the wslg make it possible to run a full fledge linux GUI without much of a hassle.\
A combination of [vcxsrv](lbzvfcl7) and [i3](l73n59zf) make my day to day life on the terminal a pleasant journey.
