In [Buddhism](2zrdipz5), a meditator is invited to [take refuge](r7k46urb) in the 3 jewels which are:
- [The Dharma](pczwzypi)
- The Buddha
- The Sangha


The Dharma is the theoretical map of [the Path](az20h0no) that each meditators explores on the way to [awakening](7wifg0oz).
Without it, one can sit for hours without fully understanding the depth of the experience.
[Insight](tpi5wwns) would be hard, and progress limited.

A sangha is a spiritual community that supports the meditation on his path.
The community can be physical but not necessarily, as I explored in my reflection on [Losing what is dear](vtbi6a8r).

The Buddha manifests every time a skill action is taken in the face of suffering.

So to sum it up, one can think of the 3 jewels as process:
1. Every time we engage with the sangha, we have a chance to practice the 8 fold path
2. When we react skilfully, a buddha manifests, and then goes away.

This process and cycle is explained by the Dharma. But only practice of meditation leads to [insights](tpi5wwns) culminating in this [awakened experience of life](7wifg0oz).
