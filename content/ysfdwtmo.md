Metacognitive introspective awareness is essentially the cognition of being aware of your own cognition.

To break the 3 words down:
1. Introspective, is about seeing what is rising inside of you, and within the body
2. Awareness, is seeing all the facets of these internal waves, and their ripples
3. Metacognitive, because it is a cognitive event, but it transcends the event itself -- u just observe it as an external self, instead of the experiencing self that is suffering from it
