title: "Desire"
---

The Second Noble Truth teaches that the cause of suffering is craving or thirst (tanha). This doesn't mean cravings should be repressed or denied. Instead, in Buddhist practice, we acknowledge our passions and learn to see they are empty, **so they no longer control us**. This is true for hate, greed and other emotions. Sexual desire is no different.

The buddha said that we suffer because we desire.
Yes, but now, the student will desire to not desire.
How then, can the student reconcile this paradox?
