[Staking](notes/Passive%20Income/Staking.md), is not a “set it and forget it” process.
For many, the barrier to entry to participate in staking is high, as it requires monitoring staking performance, choosing which validator on the network to support and in some cases having their return on investment harmed by slashing.

Staking as a Service is a type of SaaS that abstracts there challenges from the user by offering a platform that takes care of the grunt work.
The user is then left to choose which coin to stake, and for how long.
