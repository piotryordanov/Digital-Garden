title: "Passive Income"
---

### Overview
We define passive income as a form of investment that does not rely on speculating on the future price outlook of an instrument.
The most known example is bank savings accounts that generate yearly yield.

Unfortunately, traditional banking system yields have been very low, if not negative at times.
Crypto passive income strategies, on the other hand, have proven to be quite lucrative. And, the more the user is willing to up his risk profile, the higher the returns are, but so are the risks.

However, even for very safe passive incomes such as lending stable coins, the investor faces a series of challenges.
The biggest challenge is also what makes crypto so attractive: The user is, and remains, the ultimate decision maker on what happens to his money. NOT the bank, or some wall guarded investment advisor.

### How to make passive income
We identify three categories of passive income strategies, categories by the risk taken. Note that riskier strategies, while on the surface look like they generate free money, they bear a risk of loss of capital (sometimes very high):
1. Safe Strategies
	1. [Lending StableCoins](Lending%20StableCoins.md)
	2. Lending already owned CryptoCoins
	3. Liquidity Providing
	4. Mining POW chains
2. Riskier Strategies
	1. [Staking](Staking.md) CryptoCoins
	2. Yield Farming
	3. Investment in ICO's
3. Special events
	1. Airdops
	2. Forks
	3. Burns
	4. BuyBacks
	5. Rewards

### Challenges
An investor with no financial education, who wishes to generate passive income,  faces a few critical challenges:
1. Deciding on what allocation to do for each strategy
2. Deciding on which platform to execute the strategy
3. Deciding which token to choose for each strategy
4. Deciding when to rebalance the portfolio between strategies
5. Executing the different strategies. Some being too complex for the unaware user.
6. Keeping up to date with new rising opportunities.

### Current solutions
There are, in the DeFi world, a number of projects that offer aggregation of solutions between liquidity providers and farms. Such projects are:
+ [Popsicle.Finance](PopsicleFinance)
+ [Popcorn.Network](PopcornNetwork)
+ [Yearn.Finance](YearnFinance)
+ [Abracadabra.Finance](AbracadabraFinance)
+ [Olympus.Finance](OlympusFinance)


However, it still is up to the user to decide which pool to get into, when to rebalance to another one, and more important, how to hedge their coins against potential market drops.

### What's missing
There exists, in the traditional finance world, [Robo-advisor](Robo-advisor.md) which abstract all the decision-making out of the user, and instead offer the investor with an interface where they select their risk profile, according to which cash is allocated.
They are essentially automated Financial advisors.
The advantage for the user is that they don't have to worry about anything.
But, it does come at a loss of freedom to pick what each individual strategy does, or, indeed, which strategy would be added or removed in the future.
However, there are no mature and established robo advisors specialized in crypto.
The traditional robo-advisors such as [Betterment](Betterment.md) or [WealthFront](https://www.wealthfront.com) are indeed trying to offer crypto solution.
But, they are often limited geographically, and their minimum capital aren't always easy for all users.
