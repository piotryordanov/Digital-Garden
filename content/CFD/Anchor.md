The anchor protocol is a popular savings app built on top of the [Terra](notes/Passive%20Income/Terra.md) ecosystem.
The Anchor Protocol coin (ANC) provides users with low-volatility yields of just under 20% when taking the Anchor Rate into account.

It's interesting to note that as of this writing, the borrow rate is at 5.12% APR because of the distribution APR, which actually means that you get paid to borrow!
This might change however.
