In [Buddhism](2zrdipz5), the path is the name given to the journey of the meditators as they grow from novice to adapt.
The destination is [Awakening](7wifg0oz), even tho there is nothing to reach and strive for.

In Zen buddhism, we often saw that we practice the path, because it a never ending process.
Awakening is itself not a goal but an effortless manifestation of different mind habits that lead to equanimity.
