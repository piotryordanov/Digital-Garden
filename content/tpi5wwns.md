Vipassanā is a buddhist term that means insight. It is described as one of the two qualities that develop during the training of the mind.
The second being samatha, or mind calming.

Vipassanā is about seeking insight into the true, objective, real, nature of things.
It is about seeing things as they are, not as we imagine or want them to be.
