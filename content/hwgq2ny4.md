I never thought I'd enjoy writing C# because of an older aversion to what it represented especially in the world of microsoft.
However, I was forced to use it in order to write algo trading bots on platforms such as cTrader or [quantower](2owt9jez)\
I ended finding an appreciation for hard typing everything. It makes programming smoother and relies less on memory.
I appreciated this particularly more when I started writing [[typescript]] in my [[react]] apps.

One of the crazy fun challenges I did, was compiling C# under [WSL](yulpo75g).
On paper, it's not hard, but because I had to generate a library used by [quantower](2owt9jez), it turned out to be quite a challenge.
