Backtesting is the art of testing the performance of a strategy on historical data.
While the platforms for backtesting are quite numerous, the most popular languages used are either python or [C#](hwgq2ny4).

### Features of a good backtesting library
Any good backtesting library needs to check a couple of boxes to be considered:
1. Community and docs:
  1.1. Is it actively developed?
  1.2. How popular is it?
  1.3. How reliable and user friendly are the docs?
2. Backtesting and optimisation:
  2.1. Does it support a wide range of data sources?
  2.2. Does it support a wide range of technical indicators?
  2.3. Does it offer strong reporting tools?
  2.4. Does it offer strong optimisation tools? With AI?
3. Deploying:
  3.1. Does it offer a seemless ability to use the code for live trading?
  3.2. Does it support many assets classes?
