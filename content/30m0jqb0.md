Meditation is a process, the systematic training of the mind.

Let's first define the scope of this training:
1. **Goal(s):** The goal is [awakening](7wifg0oz), or enlightenment.
   Each buddhist tradition defines it differently.
   I personally see it as a state of mind one reaches and maintains, where it becomes effortless to engage skilfully with day to day life.
   In buddhist terms, the goal is to live a life aligned with [The 8-fold path](kxqaql4m).
2. **Theory(Dharma)**: The journey is also a path.
   Buddhism offers the Dharma, which is a set of teachings that play the role of a map.
   Think of it like a bunch of sign posts laid down by others before you.
   The goal of them is to help you along the way, should you come across the same challenge.

3. **Teachers/Coaches**: The path is complex and hard to navigate.
   A map is good, but so is proper guidance to help see objects arising in our blind spots.
   The challenge here is in finding guidance that resonates well with you.
4. **Techniques:** This is the actual works needed to be done day in, day out, in order to achieve the goals.
   Meditation is a big umbrella word defining many practices and techniques.
   Mastering each technique, as well as knowing when and how to employ them is critical for progress.
5. **Routines/Habits:** This refers to process that puts all of the above together
   It is critical to ensure that the goal is met.
