Typescript is a strongly typed, object oriented, compiled language build on top of javascript.\
Below that fantastic mental breain-tease, what this means is that with typescript and tools such as the `tsserver`, programing is taken to a next level with smart auto-completion, intellisense, and renaming.

While it does require more effort to make sure all types are added and updated, it is after all, worth the effort.

All modern text editors such as [Vim](qt588dg2) or VsCode, offer plugins that allow such augmentation.

If you are familiar to object oriented programming languages such as C#, typescript be exactly what javascript was missing all along.
