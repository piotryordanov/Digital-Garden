VcXsrv is an X-server for windows. It allows [WSL](yulpo75g) users to run a full fledge GUI system under linux.
Note that with [wslg](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg), it became possible to run single GUI apps as if they were windows app.
However, the goal of VcXsrv is to run complex Window Managers such as i3, allowing you to stay in linux at all times.
