Mindfulness meditation is the practice of bringing one's attention in the present moment back to the breath.
Over, and over, and over again.
It is a skill developed via mindfulness meditation or other practice.


It is widely used today in clinical therapy such as Mindfulness based Cognitive behavioral therapy.

There are different ways of cultivating mindfulness:
- Mindfulness meditation is a practice of sitting and setting the intention to return to the breath every time attention goes away.
- In the plum village tradition, every time a bell rings, it is an invitation to take a moment to return to one's mindful breathing


[Thích Nhất Hạnh](o7rtp68k) is known for having written a great deal of books on the topics of mindful breathing, and finding peace in every breath.
