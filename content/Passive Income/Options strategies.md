title: "Options strategies"
---

Options are a financial instrument that are based on the value of underlying securities such as crypto coins or stocks. 
An options contract offers the buyer the opportunity to buy or sell—depending on the type of contract they hold—the underlying asset. 
Unlike futures, the holder is not required to buy or sell the asset if they decide against it.

Unlike the traditional market, especially the stock market, options are not at all popular in crypto.
Indeed, it is very hard to find options on coins other than BTC or ETH, and even then the liquidity is quite limited.
