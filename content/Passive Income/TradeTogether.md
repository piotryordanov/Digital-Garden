title: "Trade Together"

Trade Together is a crypto [Robo-advisor](notes/Passive%20Income/Robo-advisor.md) based in Singapore.
As of this writing, it is still not live and users can only subscribe to a mailing list.
From taking a look at their [Prospectus](notes/Passive%20Income/Attachments/TradeTogether-Base-prospectus-Nov-2021-Final-version.pdf), they only seem to want to offer crypto baskets based on sector, or risk profile. Similar to [Makara](notes/Passive%20Income/Makara.md).
There is no mention of lending, staking or others.
They do state that the assets would be protected in case of a bearish market condition, but without saying how.

```
Key Takeaways:
+ 6 month old crypto robo-advisor startup based in Singapore
+ Seems to offer crypto baskets without any [Passive Income](notes/Passive%20Income/Passive%20Income.md) focus
+ Co-founderes both are ex bankers at the Standard Chartered Bank. No apparent technical cofounder. Homepage is wordpress.
