### Anchor Review
1.  **The 20% APY isn't always 20%.** Currently as of writing this, the APY on the earn side is 17.93%. This is a built in mechanic where if the total earned from the borrower's interest is lower than the amount needed to pay depositors, there's a minimum yield of 18% that's paid (side note: it should be 18% so I'm not sure why it's slightly lower than 18%). If the total earned from borrower's interest is lower than 18%, we start dipping into the treasury. This 18% minimum yield can be changed through a vote by the community of ANC token holders.
2.  **UST lost a bit of it's peg.** UST is at 0.98 now which is 2% down, and it's been hanging out there for the last couple of days, while other stablecoins returned to their $1 pegs pretty fast. It's not a big deal, and I expect that it'll return to $1 sooner or later, but it shows that there's a real price variance of 2% that we should expect. Arbitragers need to pay fees too, and earning that 2% only may be too little for the fees they bear, and/or the exposure to a falling LUNA token price.
3.  **Unsustainability of the 20% returns in a bear market / flash crash scenario.** When LUNA token price crashed, a huge portion of borrowers got liquidated. This does 4 things. a. it reduced the amount of interest being earned by the protocol to pay depositors as there are fewer borrowers paying interest. b. it causes strain on the network, and there was a period of 30 mins where anchor app was down because of it (apparently this is fixed and shouldn't happen again). c. it pisses off the borrowers who may not be back. d. it increased the borrower incentive paid in ANC tokens by a ridiculous amount (currently at 164% APY), which means the supply of ANC tokens is super high now, and with demand low during a bearish period, it could cause ANC to dump.This results in 20% fixed being paid to depositors, but there's not enough flow of capital to make up the 20%. We're currently depleting the reserves, which could finish in a month, and there are two options on the table now: a. reduce the 20% / 18% rates to something more sustainable, or b. use the community pool of ANC to supplement the reserves. Doing (a) would indicate a failure of the protocol in promising 20% returns, and doing (b) would just cause another flood of ANC tokens into the market, which people may see as worthless if the protocol itself can't hold up on it's own.
4.  **Depositors funds are safe.** Aside from the 2% loss in the UST peg which I expect to be short-term, the depositors funds are safe. Even if the economic model fails, I believe that the initial capital would still be there, and if the anchor rate drops to something more sustainable like 10%, you could always choose to park your money elsewhere.We'll see how it holds up over the next month and moving forward. There's still hope and we'll see the resilience of the protocol during this tumultuous period. :)
5.  Assuming the protocol holds up and can pay 20% returns, **Nexus Mutual now has coverage for Anchor Protocol**, which is at about 6.11% per year (meaning net 12-14% APY after coverage). The coverage doesn't cover the risk of UST losing it's peg though, so bear that in mind.


### Updated review, 4 months later
Anchor has been running smoothly, borrow side APY is down to more sustainable levels, yield reserves have start accumulating and the protocol is stable for now. I expect this to continue until the next bear market or black swan event. At that point the above will probably repeat, but the protocol should still hold up.
