title: "Makara"

[Makara](https://makara.com) is, as of this writing, the only crypto robo-advisor. But, looking closely at it's features make me wonder if it's really an advisor and not more of a copy trading platform.
Indeed, it is not possible to choose an allocation based on risk profile.
Also, and most importantly, it does not offer a diversification similar to what we aim to achieve (lending, staking, arbitraging, and speculation).
Rather, the user is offered sets/baskets to buy into.

However, Makara was [acquired](https://www.investopedia.com/betterment-enters-crypto-with-makara-acquisition-5218550) by [Betterment](notes/Passive%20Income/Betterment.md) on Feb 8, 2022.
