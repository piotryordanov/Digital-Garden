title: "Staking"
---

More and more blockchains are moving away from the Proof of work (POW) into a Proof of stake (POS).
POW is very energy hungry, causing environmental concerns, while POS does not.

POS is a process that involves committing one's crypto to support the blockchain network and confirm transactions.
It can also be offered as an incentive for users who would get more benefits in a product, should they choose to stake a certain amount of this product's token.


#### Benefits of Staking crypto
Notable benefits of staking crypto are:
+ Earn passive income
+ No need for specialized hardware like GPU's
+ More environmental friendly
+ Offers benefits and/or rewards in some products.

#### Risks of Staking crypto
Just like anything in crypto, staking can endanger one's capital if risks are not mitigated properly:
+ Slashing: The validator gets punished for a fault of conduct. It is a mechanism by which the network disincentivizes abnormal behaviors.
+ Staking requires buying a coin, which can in turn lose more in value than one would make from the staking rewards
+ Staking sometimes has minimum lockup period which renders the capital unavailable for liquidation, lending, or other activities.
+ Unstaking coins can be subject to unstaking lock up period.
