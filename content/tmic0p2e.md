Arch Linux. What can I say!\
I have been familiar with it, and `pacman` for such a long time, it feels like my oldest stable relationship.
[Pacman along](1v47e9np) with the `AUR` are what make the experience worth the initial learning curve.

Of course, one can always run something like manjaro to avoid the hassle of learning how to install a fresh linux distro without a GUI or internet! However this still requires dual booting which isn't the most practical of solutions.\
Or...\
[Run it under WSL!](qfosh20u)
