title: "Enlightenmnent"
---


The English word enlightenment sometimes refers to heightened intellect and reason, a quality that can be cultivated or possessed. 
But enlightenment in the Buddhist sense is not a quality, and no one can possess it. I can only be realized.
  
The path toward enlightenment is to surrender clinging and desire altogether, which brings about the cessation of dukkha (suffering; stress; dissatisfaction).
  
> It is kind of mystery that for people who have no experience of enlightenment, enlightenment is something wonderful. But if they attain it, it is nothing. But yet it is not nothing. Do you understand?
