i3 (more specifically i3-wm or i3-gaps) is a tiled window managed.\
With a single hotkey, I split the screen in half either vertically or horizontally.
Or, I create a floating window, or maximize the current window.
All while having access to multiple workspaces and other fancy tools.

There are similar concepts on windows, but they lack the speed and flexibility of i3, especially when it comes to multiple workspace management.

However, there is a learning curve to figure out how to configure i3.
Also, on it's own it's pretty useless, and it needs to be empowered with tools such as [Polybar](https://polybar.github.io) or [rofi](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Rofi)
