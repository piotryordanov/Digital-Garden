I have been writing code for over a decade.\
Giving you an exact number of years would reveal my age, and I am too shy to do that at that stage üòÜ

My three main programming languages are [javascript](br1fz3j3), [C#](hwgq2ny4), and python.\
I do however dabble with other languages such as bash, and vim.\
Oh yes, I almost forgot to say, I have a hard time imagining a world without vim and [arch linux](tmic0p2e) (I do cheat and get on WSL)

There are 2 domains in which I have an extensive level of experience: Web development, and linux environment.

At the end of the day, I am passionate about writing code that automates tasks, but also serves to manage knowledge and build awesome products.
