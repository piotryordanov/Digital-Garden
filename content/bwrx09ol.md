Impermanence is one of the core [buddhist](2zrdipz5) doctrines.
It means that nothing last and everything fades away.
Emotions, events, and thoughts are like waves, constantly rising and falling in our experiences.
They are thus impermanent.

This impermanent nature conflicts with our desire to keep things permanent, leading to suffering.
