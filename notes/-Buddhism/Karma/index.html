They're tactical ones. We're attached to things and actions, not because of what we think they are, but because of what we think they can do for our happiness.

This is the typical understanding of happiness (Happiness of slavery). In the Dhamma sense, however, happiness is when there is no hunger or want at all, when we\'re completely free of all hunger, desire, and want. (Happiness of Freedom)\n  \nOur sense of happiness is so brittle, it can be destroyed simply by asking whether or not it exists.\n\n# Happiness\n\n## The 2 happiness\n\nImagine, if you can, that you are the sole owner of the world, of the universe, of the entire cosmos. Now that you\'re the owner of everything, does hunger stop? Can it stop? Would you please examine this carefully with and in your own mind. If you were to get everything that you could possibly desire, to the point that you owned the whole world, would your hunger cease? Or would you hunger for a second universe? Would you want a third?\n\nConsider the fact that hunger never ends by our attempts to satisfy it. In spite of this, the world today continues to develop the kind of education and evolution that seek merely to produce things which are more lovely and satisfying. Modern technology and science are slaves of hunger. Our world is falling into this deep hole of endlessly producing increasingly seductive things to try to satisfy hunger. But where are you going to find happiness in such a world?\n\n**Example:**\n\n    The new-born infant is happy when it is cuddled in its mother\'s arms and sucks milk from her breast. This satisfies the infant until it grows a little older, a little bigger. Then the mother\'s arms and breast aren’t enough. It learns about other foods and delights. Now its happiness depends on ice cream, candy, and junk food, on playing little games and running around the house. Then it grows older and those games don\'t satisfy the child any more. It wants to play football or play with dolls. These two are outgrown eventually and the teenager\'s interests and happiness revolve around sex. The previous kinds of satisfaction are of no more interest. When they become young men and women, don\'t expect them to be satisfied with the old types of happiness. Now, all they think about is sex and dates. Finally, the human being marries, becomes a wife or husband, and has hopes and wishes tied up in a house, money, and possessions. There\'s no way they can be satisfied with childish happiness (unless they haven\'t really grown up) The human being changes from stage to stage, and happiness also changes from stage to stage. It is continuous and endless. Hunger develops from stage to stage until death. After that, many believe, there is rebirth as a deva (celestial being, like angels): and still there\'s hunger, heavenly hunger for the happiness of devas. It never stops. Even in heaven with the gods or in the kingdom of God, should such things exist, hunger doesn\'t stop. In Buddhism these all are considered to be examples of worldly happiness that only deceives and confuses.    \n\n## When does hunger stop?\n\nWe must take this other path where there is no hunger. The essence of this path is the absence of the feeling of self, of "I" and "mine". \n\nIt is necessary to realize this connection between the end of hunger and the cessation of the self illusion. \n\nHunger persists as this self seeks to acquire things for itself without ever truly succeeding. \n\nWe desire one kind of \'the best\', but as soon as we get it our hunger reaches after a better \'the best\'. This has no end as long as there\'s self that wants \'the best’. Through our grasping at "the best" we\'re burdened also with "the worst". \n\nTo be free of all *dukkha*, the mind must be beyond good and evil, above best and worst-that is , it must dwell in voidness.  In voidness hunger stops and there is true happiness.\n\n## The Tree of Knowledge\n\nThose of you who are Christians or who have read the Bible will be familiar with the story of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that appears at the beginning of Genesis. It tells how God forbade Adam and Eve to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. He warned them that they would die if they did not obey. If you understand the meaning of this passage, you will understand the core of Buddhism. When there is no knowledge of good and evil, we can\'t attach to them, we\'re void and free of dukkha. Once we know about good and evil, we attach to them and must suffer dukkha. The fruit of that tree is this attachment to good and evil. This causes dukkha and dukkha is death, spiritual death.\n\nWe identify things as good and attach to them. We identify things as bad and detach from them. We are trapped in worldly conditions by our dualistic obsession with good and bad. This is the death of which God warned. Will you heed his warning?\n\nThe Buddhist solution is to be above good and evil to be void.\n\nDon\'t attach to good and evil because they are impermanent (anicca), unsatisfactory (dukkha), and not-self (anatta). Good and evil are anicca, dukkha, anatta. \n\nIf we grasp and cling to "good", we are hungry for good. If we have what is the best, we hunger for the best. No matter how "best" something is, it still causes hunger. \n\n## Natural vs Unnecessary Hunger\n\nThe body instinctually feels hunger regarding its natural needs: clothing, food, shelter, medicine, exercise. This kind of hunger is no problem. It doesn\'t cause dukkha and can be satisfied without causing dukkha.\n\nThen, there is the second kind of hunger, which is mental, that we call "*spiritual hunger*". This is the hunger of thinking born out of attachment. Spiritual hunger, being tied up with ignorance (avijja) and attachment (upadana), destroys the coolness and calm of the mind, which is true happiness and peace, thus bringing dukkha.\n\n\u003e Through attachment the human mind knows spiritual hunger.\n\nThe body has a nervous system. When it lacks something that it needs there arises a certain activity which we call "hunger". That\'s all there is to it -- tathata. Don\'t let it cook up into spiritual hunger by attaching to it as "my hunger" or the "I who hunger".\n\nWhen the body is hungry, eat mindfully and wisely. Then physical hunger won\'t disturb the mind.\n\n# Emptiness\n\nWe cannot get rid of suffering by saying, "I will not suffer." We cannot eliminate attachment by saying, "I will not be attached to anything," nor eliminate aggression by saying, "I will never become angry." Yet, we do want to get rid of suffering and the disturbing emotions that are the immediate cause of suffering. \nThe Buddha taught that to eliminate these states, which are really the results of the primary confusion of our belief in a personal self, we must get rid of the fundamental cause. \nBut we cannot simply say, "I will not believe in the personal self." The only way to eliminate suffering is to actually recognize the experience of a self as a misconception, which we do by proving directly to ourselves that there is no such personal self. We must actually realise this. Once we do, then automatically the misconception of a self and our fixation on that "self" will disappear. \nOnly by directly experiencing selflessness can we end the process of confused projection. This is why the Buddha emphasized meditation on selflessness or egolessness (emptiness). \nHowever, to meditate on egolessness, we must undertake a process that begins with a conceptual understanding of egolessness; then, based on that understanding, there can be meditation, and finally realization.\n\nInstead of focusing on differences and individuality, the realisation of emptiness is about realising that nothing exists by itself alone, but depends on other things. Just as all living beings rely on other living beings - at least their ancestors, so do even inanimate objects depend on other objects, conditions, parts and processes to arise and disappear.\n  \nTo put it simple, our perception of the world is only possible because of interaction, interrelation, dependence and exchange of information.\n  \n## Perception\n\nWhen we perceive an object, we automatically tend to label it (like nice, bad, wet, dry, light, dark, etc.). As soon as our mind puts a label  on an object, the label takes the place of the actual object in our mental processes. As our mental image or label can never represent all the different qualities and characteristics of any object, it is always just a simplified, usually exaggerated, subjective snap shot. However, our mind reacts on the basis of our own mental label of an object. No wonder we tend to react simplistic, exaggerated and subjective in many situations. All perceived objects are conditioned by our senses and our own mind. \nThis leads to the dramatic conclusion that we are not and by definition can never be objective!\n\n- - - -\n\nStop insisting on one-sided positions\n\nThe world nowadays is so overwhelmed by the power of advertising and propaganda that most people have become slaves to it.

However, this absolutely does not mean that things are deterministic. The world as shown by a century of explorations in physical science is probablistic, not deterministic.\n  Everything preceding the present moment is at least to our knowledge unchangeable. However, the present moment is a moment of uncertainty, in which the "transient self" that comes into being in this present moment is operating from a place of uncertainty, which gives them the lattitude to make choices that alter the future. And the way we pull ourself up by our bootstraps is to take advantage of that. We do our best as we gain knowledge and understanding in every moment to steer the probabilities in the direction of wisdom, virtue, awakening and compassion.\n\n[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMindIlluminated/comments/558se5/hi_i_am_upasaka_culadasa_john_yates_phd_author_of/d88nnoj/?context=3)\n\n\n- - - -\n\nAs a result one develops the clear seeing that the observed phenomena is pervaded by the three “marks of existence”: impermanence (annica), insatisfactoriness (dukkha) and emptiness of self (annata).

And that "letting go" leads to, or is, nirvana: For once the devotee realizes that there is nothing that he can do then there is nothing left to be done. Thus a philosophical argument leads to rational insight and that insight leads to, or is, nirvana (Page 5) \n- The impatient critic might ask at this juncture: what is the point of all the Buddhist texts, philosophies, theories, and injunctions, if at the end we are told merely, \'Let it all go\'? The point, of course, is that these were all necessary to bring one to the realization that they are not at all necessary to nirvana-something the devotee could not know until he had been through all the texts, philosophies, theories, and injunctions. As a child and before I could walk I had to toddle (if that is what toddlers do), and before I could toddle I had to crawl. I do not cry out with impatience, "Why did I have to crawl and toddle?

We look for what abilities we have in order to gain a happiness we want. Those abilities are then ours. The hand we can use to reach for the object we want is our hand; the loud voice we can use to scare off the bullies threatening our sister is our voice. This is why the element of control is so essential to our sense of self: We assume that the things we can control are us or ours. Then we also try to think about which part of ourselves will live to enjoy the happiness we're trying to gain. These things will change depending on the desire.\n\nUnfortunately, our desires tend to be confused and incoherent. We're also unskillful in our understanding of what happiness is. Thus we often end up with an inconsistent and misinformed collection of selves. You can see this clearly as you meditate: You find that the mind contains many different inner voices expressing many conflicting opinions as to what you should and shouldn't be doing to be happy.\n\nIt's as if you have a committee inside the mind, and the committee is rarely in order. That's because it's composed of selves you've collected from all your past strategies for trying to gain happiness, and these strategies often worked at cross-purposes. Some of them seemed to work at a time when your standards for happiness were crude, or you weren't really paying attention to the results you were getting — as when you threw a tantrum and got your mother to give you the food you wanted. These members of the committee tend to be deluded. Some of your strategies involved doing things you liked to do but actually led to suffering — as when you hit your sister and got your toy truck back. These members of the committee tend to be dishonest and deceitful: They deny the suffering they caused. This is why your committee of selves is not an orderly gathering of saints. It's more like a corrupt city council.\n\n[Source:](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/selvesnotself.html#talk1)\n\nThe Buddha understood that the issues of our life are defined by our questions. A question gives a context to the knowledge contained in its answer — a sense of where that knowledge fits and what it's good for. Some questions are skillful in that they provide a useful context for putting an end to suffering, whereas others are not. Once, one of the Buddha's monks came to see him and asked him a list of ten questions, the major philosophical questions of his time. Some of the questions concerned the nature of the world, whether it was eternal or not, finite or not; others concerned the nature and existence of the self. The Buddha refused to answer any of them, and he explained the reason for his refusal. He said it was as if a man had been shot by an arrow and was taken to a doctor, and before the doctor could take the arrow out, the man would insist that he find out first who had shot the arrow, who had made the arrow, what the arrow was made of, what kind of wood, what kind of feathers. As the Buddha said, if the doctor tried to answer all of those questions, the man would die first. The first order of business would be to take the arrow out [§3]. If the person still wanted to know the answer to those questions, he could ask afterwards.\n\n\nUsually when we hear the teaching on not-self, we think that it's an answer to questions like these: \"Do I have a self? What am I? Do I exist? Do I not exist?\" However, the Buddha listed all of these as unskillful questions \n\nSo, to repeat, the issue is not, \"What is my true self?\" but \"What kind of perception of self is skillful and when is it skillful, what kind of perception of not-self is skillful and when is it skillful?\"\n\nNormally we create a sense of self as a strategy for gaining happiness.

The concept of _dukkha_ is one of the fundamental teachings of Buddhism.\n  \n  The Four Noble Truths refer to and express the basic orientation of Buddhism in a short expression: we crave and cling to impermanent states and things, which are dukkha, "incapable of satisfying" and painful. This craving keeps us caught in samsara,the endless cycle of repeated rebirth and dying again, and the dukkha that comes with it.\n\n  It is because we see ourselves as separate from other things that we desire them, or are repulsed by them.\n  All emotions are pain because they involve dualism.\n  \n  [Buddhism -- Suffering in Christianity](Buddhism%20--%20Suffering%20in%20Christianity.md)',lastmodified:"2022-02-15T18:12:48.125093075Z",title:"Suffering"},"/notes/-Buddhism/The-Path":{content:"# II. Arising and Passing away (A\u0026P)\n\n  From that point forward you know with absolute certainty that there is something real about all this meditation stuff. That it isn’t just relaxation or self-hypnosis. That there really is something deep and wonderful about this practice, and to a larger extent, something beautiful and mysterious about life itself – and that you have directly touched it. It is as if you have discovered a secret world that is hidden right within the normal everyday world.\n\n  Along with this discovery comes another one: there have been a vast number of people who have had this experience throughout history, and they come from every conceivable background. This is not a Buddhist thing. It’s not even a meditation thing. It’s part of the human experience. You have simply followed one of many paths that lead to it. \n  \n  You begin to appreciate the pointers they left behind for others to find, as cryptic as they first appear, and you feel a grateful connection across time with these generous teachers. \n  \n  In ancient meditation manuals like the Visudimagga insight meditation does not actually begin until one reaches the A\u0026P. It is considered the initial step into Vipassana. Once one has crossed this threshold they have traversed into very rarified territory that is strange and nothing like normal meditation. Up until this point the meditation actually seemed quite mundane, required quite a bit of self-discipline and effort, and was frequently boring or even unpleasant. It was mostly a lot of work. Sort of like running each morning: for a while it is very difficult and you have to force yourself to do it, but at some point a wonderful thing happens and the running seems to do itself. Long-time runners might consider this to be the time when they really became a “runner.”\n  \n# III. Dark Night (Knowledge of Suffering)\n\n## Dissolution\n\n  I can be a fairly hyperactive and over-committed person in general, and during this stage it was as if I was given a mild tranquilizer. I slowed down physically and mentally and took my time about everything. I found that I had trouble keeping up with things that normally were not a problem. There was a vague sense of the impermanence of things, and I wanted to savor life.\n  \n## Fear\n\n  I say all this to point out that you can easily confuse yourself and become a bit paranoid during this stage if you keep looking outside yourself for the source of fear. The fear was caused by the meditation and not the dog. When I opened my eyes to take a look, the dog was chasing a squirrel.\n  \n  Acceptance\n  \n# IV. Equanimity\n\n  Along with this vibratory quality it is not unusual for meditators to experience lights and other similar phenomena that are like the A\u0026P. Rather than be fascinated by them, you will simply notice that they too are vibrating.\n  \n  Three Characteristics. The mind can focus on the fact that:\n  - The stuff you are aware of is clearly not you\n  - that everything is impermanent and whizzing in and out of existence\n  - it can focus on the characteristic that doing anything except letting go of any of it is very uncomfortable.\n  \n  The reason why the three characteristics are so important is that in these final moments before complete cessation they are the only things that are stable enough to be taken as objects.\n  \n# V. Cessation\n\nSo far on the path, there has been a gradual development of insight and letting go of everything you once thought of as “me.” \n\n1. You began in a small way, looking at body sensations and thoughts and seeing them clearly as different but interdependent phenomena that aren’t really “me” (physio-cognitive stage). \n2. You then experienced rapturous joy and peak experiences as everything arose and passed away on its own (A\u0026P)\n3. Then sunk down into the lowest lows as you discovered that nothing lasts and nothing can really be held onto (Dark Night). \n4. Now you are watching as all of reality wavers in and out of existence before you (Equanimity).\n\n\n  During the moment of cessation you were utterly gone, and yet there was an awareness there to witness it happen. What does that mean? In Buddhism, as well as other contemplative traditions, the interpretation of this has been an issue of deep debate among the great mystics and masters. Whole lineages and traditions have clashed on differing understandings of this deepest dharma. Is emptiness really empty? Is everything awareness? \n\n  For an instant you were there, then you “went out”, and yet you have a memory of it happening. \n  \n  As this process unfolds for you, you will get an insight into how profound conditioning really is. You get an intuitive sense that you are programmed to look outside yourself for solutions to things that happen within you, and upon reflection you realize that this is the result of thousands upon thousands of interactions with a world that keeps promising to deliver happiness if you simply know what to do. This very moment, and your reactions to it, are conditioned by everything that came before it, and not seeing or understanding the misleading trends in these conditions is a prison we are all in. But now you have had your first peek outside the prison, and you know for certain that there is a way out.",lastmodified:"2022-02-15T18:12:48.125093075Z",title:"The Path"},"/notes/-Buddhism/The-three-evils":{content:"| Greed        | Hate          | Ignorance     |\n|:--           |:--            |:--            |\n| Lust         | Anger         | Confusion     |\n| Desire       | Aversion      | Bewilderment  |\n| Thirst       | Irritation    | Perplexity    |\n| Craving      | Indignation   | Uncertainty   |\n| Yearning     | Resentment    | Doubt         |\n| Longing      | Opposition    | Skepticism    |\n| Wishing      | Contrariety   | Hesitancy     |\n| Hoping       | Impatience    | Indecision    |\n| Liking       | Intolerance   | Oblivion      |\n| Attraction   | Stubbornness  | Stupefaction  |\n| Tendency     | Rigidity      | Obscurity     |\n\n*More:*\n- http://dhammatalks.net/samahita/The_3_Roots.htm\n- http://www.japanese-buddhism.com/three-evils.html\n- http://jendhamuni.com/buddhism/articles/evilroots.htmG",lastmodified:"2022-02-15T18:12:48.125093075Z",title:"The 3 Evils"},"/notes/-Buddhism/saṃsāra":{content:"Saṃsāra (Sanskrit, Pali; also samsara) in [🧠 Buddhist Philosophy|Buddhism](Buddhist%20Philosophy.md) and Hinduism is the beginningless cycle of repeated birth, mundane existence and dying again.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is essentially a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as normal.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`.\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing path.\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n	github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n	publish_dir: ./public  \n	publish_branch: master\n	cname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

You can either create a new Obsidian Vault or link one that your already have.\n\n### New Vault\nIf you don't have an existing Vault, [download Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and create a new Vault in the `/content` folder that you created and cloned during the [setup](notes/setup.md) step.\n\n### Linking an existing Vault\nThe easiest way to use an existing Vault is to copy all of your files (directory and hierarchies intact) into the `/content` folder.\n\n## Settings\nGreat, now that you have your Obsidian linked to your Quartz, let's fix some settings so that they play well.\n\n1. Under Options \u003e Files and Links, set the New link format to always be Absolute Path in Vault and disabled WikiLinks so Obsidian generates regular Markdown links.\n2.

Then go to Options \u003e Hotkeys and set a hotkey for 'Insert Template' (I recomment `[cmd]+T`).

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere\n2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\n3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website.

If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\n$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat!

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### Do I need a website already?\nNo! Setting up Quartz means you set up a site too :)\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder. The only caveat is that you should reference them in your Markdown by prefixing it with a `/`.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.yaml` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an

The term also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect, often descriptively called the principle of karma, wherein intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect): good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and happier rebirths, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and bad rebirths.</p><p>However, my own interpretation of karma, is that Karma is like gravity.
It does not mean that if you do good, you will get good.
It means that, if something good or bad happens to you, and you become it, and then pass it along, then it will return to you.
Take for example a day at work where a co-worker spends their day complaining. If you are unable to stop this constant flow of negative energy, chances are that you willpower will drain, and you will return home and start complaining to your family.
If, however, you are able to cope with it, and even go as far as finding ways to calm your coworker, thus, resisting becoming his pain, you would then have put an end to the current karma.
Once you end, there will, for the time being, no longer be any rebirth of this negative energy.
That is, until new triggers in life give rise to new kinds of energies.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script>const curPage="https://secondbrain.piotryordanov.com/notes/-Buddhism/Karma".replace("https://secondbrain.piotryordanov.com",""),pathColors=[{"/moc":"#4388cc"}];let depth=-1;const parseIdsFromLinks=a=>[...new Set(a.flatMap(a=>[a.source,a.target]))],neighbours=new Set,wl=[curPage||"/","__SENTINEL"];if(depth>=0)while(depth>=0&&wl.length>0){const a=wl.shift();if(a==="__SENTINEL")depth--,wl.push("__SENTINEL");else{neighbours.add(a);const b=index.links[a]||[],c=index.backlinks[a]||[];wl.push(...b.map(a=>a.target),...c.map(a=>a.source))}}else parseIdsFromLinks(links).forEach(a=>neighbours.add(a));const data={nodes:[...neighbours].map(a=>({id:a})),links:links.filter(a=>neighbours.has(a.source)&&neighbours.has(a.target))},color=a=>{if(a.id===curPage||a.id==="/"&&curPage==="")return"var(--g-node-active)";for(const b of pathColors){const c=Object.keys(b)[0],d=b[c];if(a.id.startsWith(c))return d}return"var(--g-node)"},drag=c=>{function d(b,a){b.active||c.alphaTarget(1).restart(),a.fx=a.x,a.fy=a.y}function e(a,b){b.fx=a.x,b.fy=a.y}function f(b,a){b.active||c.alphaTarget(0),a.fx=null,a.fy=null}const a=!0,b=()=>{};return d3.drag().on("start",a?d:b).on("drag",a?e:b).on("end",a?f:b)},height=250,width=document.getElementById("graph-container").offsetWidth,simulation=d3.forceSimulation(data.nodes).force("charge",d3.forceManyBody().strength(-30)).force("link",d3.forceLink(data.links).id(a=>a.id)).force("center",d3.forceCenter()),svg=d3.select('#graph-container').append('svg').attr('width',width).attr('height',height).attr("viewBox",[-width/2,-height/2,width,height]),enableLegend=!1;if(enableLegend){const a=[{Current:"var(--g-node-active)"},{Note:"var(--g-node)"},...pathColors];a.forEach((a,b)=>{const c=Object.keys(a)[0],d=a[c];svg.append("circle").attr("cx",-width/2+20).attr("cy",height/2-30*(b+1)).attr("r",6).style("fill",d),svg.append("text").attr("x",-width/2+40).attr("y",height/2-30*(b+1)).text(c).style("font-size","15px").attr("alignment-baseline","middle")})}const link=svg.append("g").selectAll("line").data(data.links).join("line").attr("class","link").attr("stroke","var(--g-link)").attr("stroke-width",2).attr("data-source",a=>a.source.id).attr("data-target",a=>a.target.id),graphNode=svg.append("g").selectAll("g").data(data.nodes).enter().append("g"),node=graphNode.append("circle").attr("class","node").attr("id",a=>a.id).attr("r",a=>{const b=index.links[a.id]?.length||0,c=index.backlinks[a.id]?.length||0;return 3+(b+c)/4}).attr("fill",color).style("cursor","pointer").on("click",(b,a)=>{window.location.href="https://secondbrain.piotryordanov.com/"+decodeURI(a.id).replace(/\s+/g,'-')}).on("mouseover",function(f,a){d3.selectAll(".node").transition().duration(100).attr("fill","var(--g-node-inactive)");const c=parseIdsFromLinks([...index.links[a.id]||[],...index.backlinks[a.id]||[]]),d=d3.selectAll(".node").filter(a=>c.includes(a.id)),b=a.id,e=d3.selectAll(".link").filter(a=>a.source.id===b||a.target.id===b);d.transition().duration(200).attr("fill",color),e.transition().duration(200).attr("stroke","var(--g-link-active)"),d3.select(this.parentNode).select("text").raise().transition().duration(200).style("opacity",1)}).on("mouseleave",function(d,b){d3.selectAll(".node").transition().duration(200).attr("fill",color);const a=b.id,c=d3.selectAll(".link").filter(b=>b.source.id===a||b.target.id===a);c.transition().duration(200).attr("stroke","var(--g-link)"),d3.select(this.parentNode).select("text").transition().duration(200).style("opacity",0)}).call(drag(simulation)),labels=graphNode.append("text").attr("dx",12).attr("dy",".35em").text(a=>content[decodeURI(a.id).replace(/\s+/g,'-')]?.title||"Untitled").style("opacity",0).style("pointer-events","none").call(drag(simulation)),enableZoom=!0;enableZoom&&svg.call(d3.zoom().extent([[0,0],[width,height]]).scaleExtent([.25,4]).on("zoom",({transform:a})=>{link.attr("transform",a),node.attr("transform",a),labels.attr("transform",a)})),simulation.on("tick",()=>{link.attr("x1",a=>a.source.x).attr("y1",a=>a.source.y).attr("x2",a=>a.target.x).attr("y2",a=>a.target.y),node.attr("cx",a=>a.x).attr("cy",a=>a.y),labels.attr("x",a=>a.x).attr("y",a=>a.y)})</script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Piotr YORDANOV using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><a href=../../../>Home</a>
