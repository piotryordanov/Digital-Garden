We look for what abilities we have in order to gain a happiness we want. Those abilities are then ours. The hand we can use to reach for the object we want is our hand; the loud voice we can use to scare off the bullies threatening our sister is our voice. This is why the element of control is so essential to our sense of self: We assume that the things we can control are us or ours. Then we also try to think about which part of ourselves will live to enjoy the happiness we&rsquo;re trying to gain. These things will change depending on the desire.</p><p>Unfortunately, our desires tend to be confused and incoherent. We&rsquo;re also unskillful in our understanding of what happiness is. Thus we often end up with an inconsistent and misinformed collection of selves. You can see this clearly as you meditate: You find that the mind contains many different inner voices expressing many conflicting opinions as to what you should and shouldn&rsquo;t be doing to be happy.</p><p>It&rsquo;s as if you have a committee inside the mind, and the committee is rarely in order. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s composed of selves you&rsquo;ve collected from all your past strategies for trying to gain happiness, and these strategies often worked at cross-purposes. Some of them seemed to work at a time when your standards for happiness were crude, or you weren&rsquo;t really paying attention to the results you were getting â€” as when you threw a tantrum and got your mother to give you the food you wanted. These members of the committee tend to be deluded. Some of your strategies involved doing things you liked to do but actually led to suffering â€” as when you hit your sister and got your toy truck back. These members of the committee tend to be dishonest and deceitful: They deny the suffering they caused. This is why your committee of selves is not an orderly gathering of saints. It&rsquo;s more like a corrupt city council.</p><p><a href=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/selvesnotself.html#talk1 rel=noopener>Source:</a></p><p>The Buddha understood that the issues of our life are defined by our questions. A question gives a context to the knowledge contained in its answer â€” a sense of where that knowledge fits and what it&rsquo;s good for. Some questions are skillful in that they provide a useful context for putting an end to suffering, whereas others are not. Once, one of the Buddha&rsquo;s monks came to see him and asked him a list of ten questions, the major philosophical questions of his time. Some of the questions concerned the nature of the world, whether it was eternal or not, finite or not; others concerned the nature and existence of the self. The Buddha refused to answer any of them, and he explained the reason for his refusal. He said it was as if a man had been shot by an arrow and was taken to a doctor, and before the doctor could take the arrow out, the man would insist that he find out first who had shot the arrow, who had made the arrow, what the arrow was made of, what kind of wood, what kind of feathers. As the Buddha said, if the doctor tried to answer all of those questions, the man would die first. The first order of business would be to take the arrow out [Â§3]. If the person still wanted to know the answer to those questions, he could ask afterwards.</p><p>Usually when we hear the teaching on not-self, we think that it&rsquo;s an answer to questions like these: &ldquo;Do I have a self? What am I? Do I exist? Do I not exist?&rdquo; However, the Buddha listed all of these as unskillful questions</p><p>So, to repeat, the issue is not, &ldquo;What is my true self?&rdquo; but &ldquo;What kind of perception of self is skillful and when is it skillful, what kind of perception of not-self is skillful and when is it skillful?&rdquo;</p><p>Normally we create a sense of self as a strategy for gaining happiness. We look for what abilities we have in order to gain a happiness we want. Those abilities are then ours. The hand we can use to reach for the object we want is our hand; the loud voice we can use to scare off the bullies threatening our sister is our voice. This is why the element of control is so essential to our sense of self: We assume that the things we can control are us or ours.
